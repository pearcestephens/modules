This directory contains modular CSS components for the Transfer Manager.

## Structure
- `base.css` - Reset and foundational styles
- `layout.css` - Grid, spacing, container styles
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `utilities.css` - Helper classes

## Usage
Components are auto-loaded via `transfer-manager.css` which imports all modules.
