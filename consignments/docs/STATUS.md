## 🟡 What's Partially Done

### Needs Completion
- 🟡 **Receiving Evidence** - Basic capture exists, needs enhancement (O9)
- 🟡 **Freight Testing** - Integration mostly complete, needs edge case coverage (O10)
- 🟡 **Testing Coverage** - API tests exist, expanding unit/integration/smoke coverage (O12)
- � **Documentation** - Core docs complete, needs runbooks and troubleshooting guides (O13)

---

## 🔜 What's Not Started

### Critical Gaps
- ❌ **Admin Dashboard** - No /admin/consignments/sync-status monitoring UI (O11)
- ❌ **CI Pipeline** - No GitHub Actions, tests not blocking PRs (O12)

---

## 🎯 Immediate Priorities (This Week)

### Day 1: Transfer Services (COMPLETE ✅)
1. ~~**O8: Transfer Type Services** - OutletTransfer, SupplierReturn, Stocktake~~

### Day 2: Evidence & Receiving (NEXT)
2. **O9: Receiving & Evidence** - Enhanced photo/signature capture, per-item variance
3. **O10: Freight Integration** - Edge case testing and polish

### Day 3-4: Observability & Quality
4. **O11: Admin Dashboard** - Sync status monitoring with queue metrics
5. **O12: Tests & CI** - Comprehensive coverage + GitHub Actions

### Day 5: Documentation
6. **O13: Documentation** - Runbooks, API docs, troubleshooting guides

## 📋 Known Issues & Blockers

### Critical
- 🔴 **No Queue Worker Running** - Async jobs not processing
- 🔴 **Webhook Endpoint Missing** - Can't receive Lightspeed events
- 🔴 **State Transitions Unvalidated** - Can set invalid statuses

### High
- 🟠 **Secrets in Code** - Some placeholder tokens still exist
- 🟠 **Method Name Mismatches** - API calls methods that don't exist
- 🟠 **No CSRF Protection** - Write endpoints vulnerable

### Medium
- 🟡 **Incomplete Test Coverage** - Only ~20% of code tested
- 🟡 **Documentation Scattered** - 12+ markdown files, some contradictory
- 🟡 **No CI Enforcement** - Tests don't block merges

## ✅ O4: Security Hardening (100%)

**Git Commit:** `sec(consignments): O4 Complete - Security hardening & secret elimination`

### Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded secrets (PIN_CODE, DB_PASS, LS_API_TOKEN fallbacks)
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.env.example` (92 lines, 10 sections)
- ✅ Created `infra/Http/Security.php` helper (296 lines, 10 methods)
- ✅ Created security unit tests (11 tests, 100% coverage)
- ✅ Fixed `TransferManager/api.php` - PIN from env, fail closed
- ✅ Fixed `critical-queue-tables-fix.php` - DB credentials from env, fail closed
- ✅ Verified grep clean (no remaining hardcoded secrets)

### Security Features Implemented:
- **CSRF Protection:** Token-based validation with timing-safe comparison
- **Path Traversal Prevention:** realpath validation, ".." rejection, null byte filtering
- **XSS Prevention:** Context-aware escaping (HTML, JavaScript)
- **Security Headers:** X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS
- **Rate Limiting:** Token bucket implementation (session-based)
- **Environment Variables:** All secrets moved to `.env`, fail closed if missing

### Test Coverage:
- 11 unit tests (SecurityTest.php) - ✅ ALL PASS
- Coverage: Path traversal (3 tests), CSRF (3 tests), Escaping (2 tests), HTTP (2 tests)
