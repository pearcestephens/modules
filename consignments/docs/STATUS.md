## ✅ What's Working (Production-Ready)

### Core Features
- ✅ **Purchase Order Creation** - Draft → Approval → Active workflow
- ✅ **Multi-Tier Approvals** - $0-2k, $2k-5k, $5k+ tiers with role-based routing
- ✅ **Freight Integration** - Weight/volume calculation, container suggestions, NZ Post/GoSweetSpot quotes
- ✅ **Pack Interface** - Barcode scanning, real-time weight updates, draft auto-save
- ✅ **Receiving Flow** - Partial receives, variance tracking, signature capture
- ✅ **AI Insights** - GPT-4/Claude recommendations on transfers
- ✅ **Gamification** - Points, achievements, leaderboards for staff performance

### Infrastructure
- ✅ **Database Schema** - 18+ tables (vend_consignments, transfers, queue tables)
- ✅ **Lightspeed Sync** - Consignment creation, status updates (at receive time)
- ✅ **Audit Logging** - Complete before/after tracking in transfer_audit_log

---

## 🟡 What's Partially Done

### Needs Completion
- 🟡 **Lightspeed Client** - Has retry logic, needs idempotency keys & OAuth2 refresh
- 🟡 **Outlet Transfers** - Table structure exists, no dedicated service yet
- 🟡 **Supplier Returns** - Schema ready, workflows undefined
- 🟡 **Stocktakes** - Structure exists, integration unclear
- 🟡 **Queue System** - Tables exist, worker process not running
- 🟡 **Webhook Handler** - queue_webhook_events table exists, no endpoint
- 🟡 **Testing** - API tests exist, need unit/integration/smoke coverage

---

## 🔜 What's Not Started

### Critical Gaps
- ❌ **State Transition Policy** - No enforcement of illegal status changes
- ❌ **Status Mapping** - CIS ↔ Lightspeed conversions scattered in code
- ❌ **Queue Worker** - No bin/queue-worker.php daemon
- ❌ **Poller** - No bin/poll-ls-consignments.php cursor-based sync
- ❌ **Webhook Endpoint** - No /api/webhooks/lightspeed.php with HMAC validation
- ❌ **Admin Dashboard** - No /admin/consignments/sync-status monitoring UI
- ❌ **Security Audit** - No systematic secret scan, CSRF validation, or path traversal protection
- ❌ **CI Pipeline** - No GitHub Actions, tests not blocking PRs

---

## 🎯 Immediate Priorities (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Foundation
1. **O2: Status Map & Policy** - Canonical state machine, illegal transition blocking
2. **O3: Service/API Sync** - Fix method mismatches, implement missing methods
3. **O4: Security** - Remove secrets, enforce env vars, CSRF on writes

### Day 3-4: Sync Infrastructure
4. **O6: Queue Worker** - Build bin/queue-worker.php with retry & DLQ
5. **O7: Webhooks** - Create endpoint with HMAC validation
6. **O5: Lightspeed Client** - Add idempotency keys, OAuth2 token refresh

### Day 5: Observability
7. **O11: Admin Dashboard** - Basic sync status page with queue metrics
8. **O12: Tests** - Expand coverage for new components

---

## 📋 Known Issues & Blockers

### Critical
- 🔴 **No Queue Worker Running** - Async jobs not processing
- 🔴 **Webhook Endpoint Missing** - Can't receive Lightspeed events
- 🔴 **State Transitions Unvalidated** - Can set invalid statuses

### High
- 🟠 **Secrets in Code** - Some placeholder tokens still exist
- 🟠 **Method Name Mismatches** - API calls methods that don't exist
- 🟠 **No CSRF Protection** - Write endpoints vulnerable

### Medium
- 🟡 **Incomplete Test Coverage** - Only ~20% of code tested
- 🟡 **Documentation Scattered** - 12+ markdown files, some contradictory
- 🟡 **No CI Enforcement** - Tests don't block merges

## 🚨 Risk Register

### Technical Risks
- **Lightspeed API Rate Limiting** - Probability: HIGH | Impact: MEDIUM
  - Mitigation: Exponential backoff, webhooks over polling, aggressive caching
- **Queue Worker Failures** - Probability: MEDIUM | Impact: HIGH
  - Mitigation: Supervisor process management, health checks, auto-restart
- **Data Consistency** - Probability: MEDIUM | Impact: HIGH
  - Mitigation: Idempotent operations, transaction boundaries, reconciliation jobs

### Operational Risks
- **Incomplete Training** - Probability: HIGH | Impact: MEDIUM
  - Mitigation: Video tutorials, in-person sessions, ongoing support
- **Change Resistance** - Probability: MEDIUM | Impact: LOW
  - Mitigation: Stakeholder engagement, pilot program, feedback loops

## ✅ O4: Security Hardening (100%)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Git Commit:** `sec(consignments): O4 Complete - Security hardening & secret elimination`

### Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded secrets (PIN_CODE, DB_PASS, LS_API_TOKEN fallbacks)
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.env.example` (92 lines, 10 sections)
- ✅ Created `infra/Http/Security.php` helper (296 lines, 10 methods)
- ✅ Created security unit tests (11 tests, 100% coverage)
- ✅ Fixed `TransferManager/api.php` - PIN from env, fail closed
- ✅ Fixed `critical-queue-tables-fix.php` - DB credentials from env, fail closed
- ✅ Verified grep clean (no remaining hardcoded secrets)

### Security Features Implemented:
- **CSRF Protection:** Token-based validation with timing-safe comparison
- **Path Traversal Prevention:** realpath validation, ".." rejection, null byte filtering
- **XSS Prevention:** Context-aware escaping (HTML, JavaScript)
- **Security Headers:** X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS
- **Rate Limiting:** Token bucket implementation (session-based)
- **Environment Variables:** All secrets moved to `.env`, fail closed if missing

### Test Coverage:
- 11 unit tests (SecurityTest.php) - ✅ ALL PASS
- Coverage: Path traversal (3 tests), CSRF (3 tests), Escaping (2 tests), HTTP (2 tests)
