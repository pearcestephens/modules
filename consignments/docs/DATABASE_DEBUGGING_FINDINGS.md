# DATABASE DEBUGGING FINDINGS & PROBLEMS

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Session:** Pack Page Transfer Loading Issues  
**Transfer ID Tested:** #13218  
**Status:** RESOLVED ‚úÖ

---

## üö® CRITICAL PROBLEMS DISCOVERED

### Problem 1: Silent Database Connection Failures
**Issue:** `Kernel::boot()` could fail silently without establishing database connection  
**Impact:** Pack page showed "Transfer Not Found" even when transfer existed  
**Root Cause:** `app.php` errors prevented `Kernel::boot()` from running, no fallback connection  

**Solution:**
```php
// Added to BaseTransferController constructor
private function ensureDatabaseConnection(): void
{
    try {
        $mysqli = Db::mysqli();
        if (!$mysqli->ping()) {
            throw new \Exception('Database ping failed');
        }
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        // Fallback: Load mysql.php and establish connection
        global $con;
        if (!$con instanceof \mysqli) {
            $mysqlPath = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/assets/functions/mysql.php';
            if (file_exists($mysqlPath)) {
                require_once $mysqlPath;
                if (function_exists('connectToSQL')) {
                    connectToSQL();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Problem 2: Silent SQL Errors
**Issue:** `catch(\Throwable)` blocks swallowed all SQL errors without logging  
**Impact:** No error messages, silent failures, impossible to debug  
**Root Cause:** Overly broad exception catching without error logging  

**Solution:**
```php
// Added explicit error logging
if (!$stmt) {
    error_log("BaseTransferController: Prepare failed - " . $mysqli->error);
    return null;
}

if (!$stmt->execute()) {
    error_log("BaseTransferController: Execute failed - " . $stmt->error);
    return null;
}

if (!$transfer) {
    error_log("BaseTransferController: Transfer #$id not found or filtered out");
}
```

**Lesson:** Always log SQL errors before returning null/false

---

### Problem 3: Wrong Column Name - users.name
**Issue:** Query used `users.name` but users table has `first_name` and `last_name`  
**Impact:** SQL error "Unknown column 'users.name'"  
**Root Cause:** Assumption about users table structure without verification  

**Wrong Query:**
```sql
SELECT transfers.*, users.name as created_by_name
FROM transfers
LEFT JOIN users ON transfers.created_by = users.id
```

**Correct Query:**
```sql
SELECT transfers.*, 
       CONCAT(COALESCE(users.first_name, ''), ' ', COALESCE(users.last_name, '')) as created_by_name
FROM transfers
LEFT JOIN users ON transfers.created_by = users.id
```

**Lesson:** Never assume column names - always verify table structure first

---

### Problem 4: Wrong vend_outlets Deletion Pattern
**Issue:** Used `deleted_at IS NULL` but vend_outlets uses `deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'` for active  
**Impact:** LEFT JOIN returned NULL for all outlet names despite valid UUIDs  
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent deletion patterns across tables  

**Wrong Query:**
```sql
LEFT JOIN vend_outlets outlet_from ON transfers.outlet_from = outlet_from.id 
    AND outlet_from.deleted_at IS NULL
```

**Correct Query:**
```sql
LEFT JOIN vend_outlets vend_outlets_from ON transfers.outlet_from = vend_outlets_from.id 
    AND vend_outlets_from.deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
```

**Result:** Outlet names now display correctly ("Hamilton East" instead of UUID)

---

### Problem 5: Wrong vend_products Deletion Pattern
**Issue:** Used `deleted_at IS NULL` but vend_products uses `deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'` for active  
**Impact:** Product names would not load in transfer items  
**Root Cause:** Same inconsistent deletion pattern issue  

**Wrong Query:**
```sql
LEFT JOIN vend_products ON transfer_items.product_id = vend_products.id 
    AND vend_products.deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND vend_products.is_deleted = 0
```

**Correct Query:**
```sql
LEFT JOIN vend_products ON transfer_items.product_id = vend_products.id 
    AND vend_products.deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
    AND vend_products.is_active = 1
    AND vend_products.is_deleted = 0
```

---

### Problem 6: Wrong transfer_items Deletion Field
**Issue:** Used `deleted_at IS NULL` but transfer_items uses `deleted_by IS NULL` for active  
**Impact:** Would filter out active transfer items incorrectly  
**Root Cause:** Different deletion tracking method for transfer_items table  

**Wrong Query:**
```sql
WHERE transfer_items.transfer_id = ? AND transfer_items.deleted_at IS NULL
```

**Correct Query:**
```sql
WHERE transfer_items.transfer_id = ? AND transfer_items.deleted_by IS NULL
```

---

## üìä DATABASE SCHEMA INCONSISTENCIES DISCOVERED

### Deletion Patterns Vary By Table

| Table | Active Record Pattern | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| **transfers** | `deleted_at IS NULL AND (deleted_by IS NULL OR deleted_by = 0)` | Dual deletion tracking |
| **transfer_items** | `deleted_by IS NULL` | Uses deleted_by ONLY (no deleted_at) |
| **vend_outlets** | `deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'` | Uses zero-date, NOT NULL |
| **vend_products** | `deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00' AND is_active = 1 AND is_deleted = 0` | Triple deletion checking |
| **vend_suppliers** | `deleted_at IS NULL` | Standard NULL pattern |
| **vend_inventory** | `deleted_at IS NULL` | Standard NULL pattern |
| **users** | `staff_active = 1` | Uses active flag, not deletion |

**Critical Lesson:** NEVER assume deletion patterns - always check schema documentation first!

## üîç ACTUAL DATABASE VALUES FOUND

### Transfer #13218 Data
```
id: 13218
outlet_from: '02dcd191-ae2b-11e6-f485-8eceed6eeafb' (UUID)
outlet_to: '0a4735cc-4971-11e7-fc9e-e474383c52ab' (UUID)
state: 'OPEN'
created_at: [timestamp]
deleted_at: NULL
deleted_by: NULL
```

### vend_outlets Records
```
id: '02dcd191-ae2b-11e6-f485-8eceed6eeafb'
name: 'Hamilton East'
deleted_at: '0000-00-00 00:00:00'

id: '0a4735cc-4971-11e7-fc9e-e474383c52ab'
name: 'Frankton'
deleted_at: '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
```

**Key Finding:** vend_outlets.id is varchar UUID, NOT integer - joins must match exact string

---

## ‚úÖ QUERY PATTERNS THAT WORK

### 1. Load Transfer with Outlet Names
```sql
SELECT transfers.*, 
       vend_outlets_from.name as outlet_from_name,
       vend_outlets_from.physical_city as outlet_from_city,
       vend_outlets_from.is_warehouse as outlet_from_warehouse,
       vend_outlets_to.name as outlet_to_name,
       vend_outlets_to.physical_city as outlet_to_city,
       vend_outlets_to.is_warehouse as outlet_to_warehouse,
       CONCAT(COALESCE(users.first_name, ''), ' ', COALESCE(users.last_name, '')) as created_by_name
FROM transfers
LEFT JOIN vend_outlets vend_outlets_from ON transfers.outlet_from = vend_outlets_from.id 
                                         AND vend_outlets_from.deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
LEFT JOIN vend_outlets vend_outlets_to ON transfers.outlet_to = vend_outlets_to.id 
                                       AND vend_outlets_to.deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
LEFT JOIN users ON transfers.created_by = users.id
WHERE transfers.id = ? AND transfers.deleted_at IS NULL
```

### 2. Load Transfer Items with Product Data
```sql
SELECT transfer_items.*, 
       vend_products.name as product_name,
       vend_products.sku,
       vend_products.brand,
       vend_products.supplier_id,
       vend_products.price_including_tax,
       vend_products.price_excluding_tax,
       vend_products.supply_price,
       vend_products.avg_weight_grams,
       vend_products.has_inventory,
       vend_products.active as product_active,
       vend_suppliers.name as supplier_name,
       stock_from.inventory_level as stock_from,
       stock_from.reorder_point as reorder_from,
       stock_to.inventory_level as stock_to,
       vend_categories.name as category_name
FROM transfer_items
LEFT JOIN vend_products ON transfer_items.product_id = vend_products.id 
                       AND vend_products.deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
                       AND vend_products.is_active = 1
                       AND vend_products.is_deleted = 0
LEFT JOIN vend_suppliers ON vend_products.supplier_id = vend_suppliers.id 
                         AND vend_suppliers.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN vend_inventory stock_from ON vend_products.id = stock_from.product_id 
                                    AND stock_from.outlet_id = ? 
                                    AND stock_from.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN vend_inventory stock_to ON vend_products.id = stock_to.product_id 
                                  AND stock_to.outlet_id = ?
                                  AND stock_to.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN vend_categories ON vend_products.brand_id = vend_categories.categoryID 
                          AND vend_categories.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE transfer_items.transfer_id = ? AND transfer_items.deleted_by IS NULL
ORDER BY vend_products.name ASC
```

## üéØ DEBUGGING TECHNIQUES THAT WORKED

### 1. Error Logging Strategy
```php
// Add before every SQL operation
if (!$stmt) {
    error_log("Context: Prepare failed - " . $mysqli->error);
    return null;
}

if (!$stmt->execute()) {
    error_log("Context: Execute failed - " . $stmt->error);
    return null;
}
```

### 2. Testing with bot=1 Parameter
```bash
curl -s 'https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/modules/consignments/?page=pack&id=13218&bot=1'
```
- Bypasses authentication
- Allows rapid testing without login
- Shows exact error output

### 3. Tail Logs Immediately After Request
```bash
curl 'https://...' && tail -50 /path/to/logs/error.log
```
- Shows errors in real-time
- Catches silent failures
- Reveals exact SQL errors

### 4. Direct Database Verification
```bash
mysql -u user -p database -e "SELECT * FROM transfers WHERE id = 13218"
```
- Confirms data exists
- Reveals actual column values
- Shows deletion patterns

## üìö LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Never Assume Column Names
‚ùå **Wrong:** Assume `users.name` exists  
‚úÖ **Right:** Check schema, use `CONCAT(first_name, last_name)`

### 2. Never Assume Deletion Patterns
‚ùå **Wrong:** Use `deleted_at IS NULL` everywhere  
‚úÖ **Right:** Check each table's specific pattern

### 3. Always Log SQL Errors
‚ùå **Wrong:** `catch(\Throwable) { return null; }`  
‚úÖ **Right:** Log error, then return null

### 4. Test Database Connection Early
‚ùå **Wrong:** Assume Kernel::boot() worked  
‚úÖ **Right:** Verify with `$mysqli->ping()`, provide fallback

### 5. Use Specific JOIN Aliases
‚ùå **Wrong:** `LEFT JOIN vend_outlets outlet_from`  
‚úÖ **Right:** `LEFT JOIN vend_outlets vend_outlets_from` (clear, no ambiguity)

### 6. Document While Debugging
‚ùå **Wrong:** Fix and forget  
‚úÖ **Right:** Document findings immediately (like this file!)

---

## üîí COMPANY-SPECIFIC DATABASE RULES CONFIRMED

### Rule 1: NO ALIASES Unless 100% Needed
- Use real column names: `outlet_from`, `outlet_to`, `deleted_by`
- Avoid: `from_outlet_id`, `to_outlet_id` (these don't exist)

### Rule 2: Check Deletion Pattern Per Table
- vend_outlets: `deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'`
- vend_products: `deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00' AND is_active = 1 AND is_deleted = 0`
- transfer_items: `deleted_by IS NULL`
- transfers: `deleted_at IS NULL AND (deleted_by IS NULL OR deleted_by = 0)`

### Rule 3: Always Include All Active Filters
For vend_products, ALWAYS use all three:
```sql
vend_products.deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
AND vend_products.is_active = 1
AND vend_products.is_deleted = 0
```

Missing even one filter can return incorrect results.

Outlet From: "Hamilton East" ‚úÖ
Outlet To: "Frankton" ‚úÖ
Products: Loading with names and data ‚úÖ
Error Logs: Detailed logging active ‚úÖ
```

## üöÄ PERFORMANCE NOTES

### JOIN Order Matters
- Put most selective joins first
- Use INNER JOIN when relationship is required
- Use LEFT JOIN when relationship is optional

### Index Usage Confirmed
- transfers.id: PRIMARY KEY (fast)
- vend_outlets.id: PRIMARY KEY varchar (fast, exact match)
- vend_products.id: PRIMARY KEY (fast)
- transfer_items.transfer_id: Should have index (verify with EXPLAIN)

### Query Optimization Applied
- Use COALESCE for nullable fields in CONCAT
- Order by meaningful columns (vend_products.name)
- Limit stock lookups to specific outlets only

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

### 1. Update All API Endpoints
Search codebase for:
- `deleted_at IS NULL` on vend_outlets ‚Üí Change to `= '0000-00-00 00:00:00'`
- `deleted_at IS NULL` on vend_products ‚Üí Change to `= '0000-00-00 00:00:00'`
- `deleted_at IS NULL` on transfer_items ‚Üí Change to `deleted_by IS NULL`

### 2. Add Database Wrapper Methods
```php
// Add to Db class
public static function isActiveOutlet(string $field = 'deleted_at'): string {
    return "$field = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'";
}

public static function isActiveProduct(string $prefix = 'vend_products'): string {
    return "$prefix.deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00' 
            AND $prefix.is_active = 1 
            AND $prefix.is_deleted = 0";
}
```

### 3. Create Query Testing Suite
- Unit tests for each common query pattern
- Test with real database (not mocks)
- Verify row counts match expectations

### 4. Schema Documentation Maintenance
- Keep DATABASE_SCHEMA_COMPLETE.md updated
- Document any schema changes immediately
- Include examples of working queries
