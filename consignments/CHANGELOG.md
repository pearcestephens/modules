### Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **Database schema completely redesigned** - Requires migration
- **API endpoints restructured** - All `/api/consignments/*` endpoints changed
- **Status values changed** - Old statuses incompatible with new system
- **Authentication required** - All API endpoints now require valid session
- **Webhook endpoint URL changed** - Update in Lightspeed admin panel
- **Service layer completely rewritten** - Old service calls will fail

#### Non-Breaking Changes
- Improved performance with database indexing
- Better error messages with structured responses
- Enhanced logging with correlation IDs
- Improved code organization (PSR-12 compliance)

---

### Deprecated
- Old `/consignments.php` endpoint (removed)
- Legacy status constants (replaced with Status classes)

- Synchronous Lightspeed API calls (use queue system)

---

### Removed
- Removed old monolithic `consignments.php` file
- Removed hardcoded Lightspeed credentials (use .env)
- Removed synchronous webhook processing (now queued)
- Removed legacy status fields
- Removed unused helper functions

---

### Fixed
- Fixed race conditions in job claiming (now uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`)
- Fixed webhook replay vulnerability (added timestamp validation)
- Fixed memory leaks in queue worker (proper cleanup)
- Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities (prepared statements everywhere)
- Fixed file upload security issues (proper validation)
- Fixed stuck job handling (heartbeat monitoring)
- Fixed concurrent worker conflicts (atomic operations)

---

### Security
- Implemented HMAC-SHA256 webhook validation
- Added replay attack prevention (5-minute window)
- Enforced input validation on all endpoints
- Implemented rate limiting (100 req/min for webhooks, 300 req/min for API)
- Added CSRF protection for admin endpoints
- Secured file uploads (whitelist, size limits, sanitized filenames)
- Removed secrets from code (all in .env)
- Added security scanning in CI/CD

## Migration Guide: 1.x → 2.0.0

### Prerequisites
1. **Backup everything**: Database, files, configurations
2. **Review breaking changes** (above)
3. **Test in staging environment first**
4. **Schedule downtime** (estimated 2-4 hours)

### Step-by-Step Migration

#### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Backup current database
mysqldump consignments_prod > backup_pre_2.0.0_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Run migration scripts (in order)
mysql consignments_prod < database/01-queue-tables.sql
mysql consignments_prod < database/02-webhook-tables.sql
mysql consignments_prod < database/03-consignment-updates.sql
mysql consignments_prod < database/04-receiving-evidence.sql
mysql consignments_prod < database/05-status-migration.sql
mysql consignments_prod < database/10-freight-bookings.sql

# Verify migrations
mysql consignments_prod -e "SHOW TABLES;"
```

#### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy new environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add required variables:
# - LS_WEBHOOK_SECRET (from Lightspeed admin)
# - DB credentials
# - SMTP settings
# - Freight provider settings

# Verify configuration
php bin/verify-config.php
```

#### 3. Update Lightspeed Webhook URL
1. Log into Lightspeed admin panel
2. Navigate to Settings → Webhooks
3. Update URL to: `https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/consignments/public/webhooks/lightspeed.php`
4. Verify secret matches `.env` file
5. Test webhook with sample event

#### 4. Deploy Code
```bash
# Pull new code
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# Set permissions
chmod -R 755 uploads/
chown -R www-data:www-data uploads/ logs/
```

#### 5. Start Queue Worker
```bash
# Install systemd service
sudo cp infrastructure/systemd/consignments-queue.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable consignments-queue.service
sudo systemctl start consignments-queue.service

# Verify running
sudo systemctl status consignments-queue.service
```

#### 6. Configure Poller Cron
```bash
# Add to crontab
crontab -e

# Add line:
*/5 * * * * cd /var/www/modules/consignments && php bin/poll-ls-consignments.php >> logs/poller.log 2>&1
```

#### 7. Verify Installation
```bash
# Run test suite
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Check admin dashboard
# Visit: https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/consignments/admin/dashboard.php

# Verify queue processing
tail -f logs/queue-worker.log

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/consignments/public/webhooks/lightspeed.php \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Lightspeed-Signature: sha256=$(echo -n '{}' | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac 'YOUR_SECRET' | cut -d' ' -f2)" \
  -d '{"event_id":"test","event_type":"consignment.test","created_at":"2025-11-02T10:00:00Z","data":{}}'
```

### Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If migration fails and you need to rollback:

```bash
# 1. Stop new services
sudo systemctl stop consignments-queue.service

# 2. Restore database
mysql consignments_prod < backup_pre_2.0.0_YYYYMMDD.sql

# 3. Revert code
git checkout <previous-stable-tag>
composer install

# 4. Update Lightspeed webhook URL back to old endpoint

# 5. Restart services
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm
```

## Performance Improvements

- **Queue worker**: Atomic job claiming eliminates race conditions
- **Database indexes**: Added covering indexes for hot queries (50-80% faster)
- **OpCache**: PHP OpCache enabled (40% improvement)
- **Batch processing**: Poller fetches 100 consignments per request
- **Connection pooling**: Reuses database connections
- **Async webhooks**: Non-blocking webhook processing

## Known Issues

None at time of release.
