## QUESTION 16: Product Search & Autocomplete
**Category:** UI/UX - Discovery & Selection
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** All workflows (PO creation, receiving, transfers)

### The Question

When users search for products to add to POs or transfers, we need intelligent autocomplete:

1. **Scope:** Should search include:
   - SKU? (e.g., "SKU-12345")
   - Product name? (e.g., "Vape Tank Pro")
   - Barcode? (UPC/EAN)
   - Category? (e.g., "Mods", "Tanks", "E-Liquids")
   - Supplier? (which supplier has it?)
   - All of the above?

2. **Filtering:**
   - For POs: Show only products offered by THIS supplier?
   - For transfers: Show only products available at SOURCE outlet?
   - For receiving: Show only products on THIS PO?
   - Exclude discontinued products? Always or configurable?

3. **Speed & Performance:**
   - Minimum characters before search triggers? (e.g., 3 chars)
   - Debounce time? (e.g., 300ms)
   - Max results shown? (e.g., 50, 100, unlimited?)
   - Cache results client-side? How long?

4. **Results Display:**
   - Show: SKU | Name | Current Stock | Supplier? | Last Ordered?
   - Sort by: Relevance? Popularity? Alphabetical?
   - Multi-select support? (add multiple at once)

5. **Behavior:**
   - Keyboard support? (arrow keys, enter, escape)
   - Click to select or other method?
   - Can users add products not in catalog? (custom SKU entry fallback)

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Scope (What to Search):**
- Product name ✅
- Image ✅
- SKU ✅
- Price ✅
- Inventory from SOURCE outlet ✅
- Filter by: Supplier/Brand (bonus, if available) ✅

**Filtering:**
- Show only products IN STOCK at SOURCE outlet
- Allow 0 stock products but WARN user
- No inventory filtering by other outlets

**Performance:**
- 2-3 keys minimum before search triggers ✅
- Standard debounce & performance ✅
- Cache: Not critical

**Display:**
- Product name, image, SKU, price, inventory
- Sort by: Relevancy & popularity (not strict requirement)

**Multi-Select:**
- Yes - full multi-select support ✅
- Shift+click keyboard power-user shortcuts ✅

**Behavior:**
- No custom SKU entry
- **BONUS FEATURE:** Option to add products to other consignments (packing workflow)
- Products can be added from source and to other consignments in workflow

**Implementation Notes:**
```
1. Query vend_products with outlet_id = source_outlet
2. Include image from vend_products.image_url
3. Show warning badge if quantity = 0
4. Multi-select UI with shift-click support
5. Search on 2-3+ characters
6. Sort results by popularity (order frequency) then relevancy
7. Allow users to add same product to other open consignments
```

## QUESTION 17: PO Amendment & Cancellation Rules
**Category:** Business Logic - Lifecycle Management
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** PO workflow, supplier relationships, receiving

### The Question

POs (consignments) can be amended or cancelled after creation. What are the rules?

1. **Amendment:**
   - Can you amend a DRAFT PO? (edit items, qty, dates)
   - Can you amend a SENT PO? (while in transit)
   - Can you amend a RECEIVED PO? (after partial receipt)
   - Restrictions: Which fields can be changed? (qty? dates? supplier?)
   - Approval: Does amendment require re-approval?

2. **Cancellation:**
   - Can you cancel a DRAFT PO?
   - Can you cancel a SENT PO? (recall from supplier?)
   - Can you cancel a RECEIVED PO? (can't undo receiving)
   - Workflow: Mark as CANCELLED? Or delete entirely?
   - Audit: Keep history or erase?

3. **Over-Receipt Handling:**
   - If supplier sends MORE than ordered, what happens?
   - Can you receive over 100% qty? (e.g., 105% of PO qty)
   - How much over is acceptable? (5%? 10%? configurable?)
   - Do you need approval for over-receipt?

4. **Supplier Communication:**
   - Should supplier be notified of amendments/cancellations?
   - Email templates for each scenario?
   - Reason field required? (mandatory or optional)

5. **Integration Impact:**
   - If amended → need to re-sync Lightspeed? Or just CIS?
   - If cancelled → delete from Lightspeed? Or mark CANCELLED there?
   - What if Lightspeed already received partial inventory?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Amendment Rules:**
- DRAFT: 100% can be edited - DEFAULT STATE before sent to stores ✅
- PACKED: Can amend once packed ✅
- SENT: Cannot amend once sent ✅
- RECEIVED: YES can amend - add products, change quantities ✅
- Approval needed: NO ✅

**Sent Timing:**
- Auto-applied 12 hours after packing OR
- Triggered by courier webhooks ✅

**Cancellation Rules:**
- Can cancel if DRAFT only ✅
- Status shows CANCELLED (not deleted) ✅
- Cancel button: Only visible to management (not on page itself)
- Mark as: CANCELLED status ✅

**Over-Receipt Handling:**
- ANY quantity over stock ACCEPTED ✅
- No approval required ✅
- Accepted without restriction

**Notifications & Communication:**
- DRAFT notification emails created & displayed to management ✅
- Displayed on INDEX dashboard
- Email template: Search functions for existing email template ✅
- Template suitable for DRAFT notification

**Reason Field:**
- Auto-generated from data ✅
- Staff message optional (can add notes) ✅

**Lightspeed Sync:**
- If amended: Update that single consignment in CIS/Vend ✅
- If cancelled: Mark CANCELLED status in both systems ✅

**Implementation Notes:**
```
WORKFLOW:
1. Create → DRAFT (default, fully editable)
2. Pack → ready to send
3. SENT trigger (auto 12h OR webhook) → cannot amend
4. RECEIVED → can amend (add products, change qty)
5. CANCELLED → management only, mark status

EMAIL:
- Template location: /assets/functions/email_template*
- Purpose: Notify management of DRAFT consignments
- Display: INDEX dashboard widget

RULES:
- Amend DRAFT unlimited times
- Amend RECEIVED always
- No approvals ever
- Over-stock no limit
```

## QUESTION 18: Duplicate PO Prevention
**Category:** Business Logic - Data Integrity
**Complexity:** Low-Medium
**Affects:** PO creation, supplier ordering

### The Question

How do we prevent duplicate POs being created?

1. **Detection Method:**
   - Check for exact duplicate? (same supplier, same items, same qty)
   - Or fuzzy matching? (similar items within X% qty tolerance)
   - Or just warn without preventing?
   - Time window: Within last X days/weeks?

2. **Handling:**
   - Block creation entirely? Show error?
   - Allow duplicate with warning? ("PO #123 very similar, continue?")
   - Merge with existing? (add to existing PO instead)
   - Just log in audit trail?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if user intentionally wants to order same items twice? (staff meeting needs tea, then party needs tea)
   - What if first PO is CANCELLED? Can you create identical one now?
   - What about seasonal items? (Christmas stock ordered every year)

4. **Configuration:**
   - Enable/disable duplicate checking?
   - Configurable per supplier?
   - Configurable time window?

5. **Reporting:**
   - Alert on duplicate detection? (email to approver)
   - Dashboard showing potential duplicates?
   - Bulk merge tool?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Duplicate Detection:**
- Only flag if SAME EVERYTHING including status ✅
- Same supplier + same products + same quantities + same status = duplicate
- Not a major concern - informational/helpful ✅

**Behavior:**
- Show warning: "Similar PO exists, merge or continue?" ✅
- Allow user choice: merge into existing or create new
- Not blocking, just informational

**Timing:**
- Check when SAVING consignment ✅
- Check when SENDING consignment (final check) ✅

**Status Consideration:**
- Check against: DRAFT, PACKED, SENT, DISPATCHED statuses ✅
- EXCLUDE from check: RECEIVED, CANCELLED statuses
- Rationale: Don't warn about completed/cancelled consignments

**Implementation Notes:**
```
DETECTION LOGIC:
1. When saving/sending → query for similar consignments
2. Match: supplier_id + product_ids + quantities + status
3. If found → show modal: "Similar consignment exists"
4. Options: "Merge into existing" OR "Create new" OR "Cancel"
5. Not a blocker - user can override

QUERY:
SELECT * FROM queue_consignments
WHERE supplier_id = ?
  AND status IN ('DRAFT', 'PACKED', 'SENT', 'DISPATCHED')
  AND NOT status IN ('RECEIVED', 'CANCELLED')
  AND consignment_id != current_id
  AND [check product list matches]
```

## QUESTION 21: Multi-Tier Approval - Thresholds
**Category:** Business Logic - Approval Workflow
**Complexity:** High
**Affects:** All consignments, supplier relationships, authorization

### The Question

Should there be **approval thresholds** based on consignment value?

**Examples of approval structures:**
- **No approval needed:** All consignments approved automatically
- **Single tier:** All > $X need manager approval
- **Two tier:** $0-$2k: auto, $2k-$10k: manager, $10k+: director
- **Three tier:** $0-$1k: auto, $1k-$5k: manager, $5k+: director + finance
- **By supplier:** Different thresholds per supplier (high-trust vs new suppliers)

**If thresholds used:**
1. Should approval happen BEFORE sending (pre-approval) or AFTER creation (post-creation approval)?
2. Who approves? (specific role, specific person, manager of staff member)?
3. What happens if PO is rejected? (return to draft, delete, notify supplier?)
4. Can users resubmit after rejection? (what's the flow?)
5. Can approvers change the PO quantities/products before approving?
6. Timeout for approval? (auto-approve if not approved in 48h?)
7. Escalation? (if not approved in 24h, escalate to next level?)

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Configurable approval thresholds:**
- Per supplier (trusted suppliers auto-approve, new suppliers need manager approval)
- Per product category (high-value items like mods need approval, commodity items auto)
- Per user (staff members under $5k auto, managers under $10k, director all)
- Pre-approval flow: Create DRAFT → Pending Approval → Send when approved
- Rejection: Return to DRAFT, reason provided, can resubmit immediately
- Timeout: Auto-approve if pending > 48 hours (don't let approvals block forever)
- Escalation: If pending > 24h, escalate to next level manager + send reminder email
- Can approvers modify? Yes, can adjust quantities/products before approving
- Configuration: Admin panel to set thresholds per supplier/category/role

## QUESTION 22: Multi-Tier Approval - Access Control
**Category:** Business Logic - Authorization & Roles
**Complexity:** High
**Affects:** User permissions, audit trails, compliance

### The Question

How should role-based approval work?

**Current roles in system:**
- Store Staff (packing, receiving)
- Store Manager
- Head Office / District Manager
- Finance Lead
- Director/Owner

**What should each role be able to do?**

1. **Create PO:** Who can create? (anyone, managers only, head office only?)
2. **Edit DRAFT PO:** Who can edit? (creator only, any manager, anyone?)
3. **Send PO:** Who can send? (creator, any manager, approval required first?)
4. **Approve PO:** Who can approve? (manager, specific person, multi-person?)
5. **Receive PO:** Who can receive? (store staff, managers only?)
6. **Amend PO:** Who can amend? (creator, manager, finance team?)
7. **Cancel PO:** Who can cancel? (creator, managers, head office only?)
8. **View audit trail:** Who can see who did what? (managers, finance, everyone?)
9. **Override approvals:** Can anyone bypass approval thresholds? (director only?)

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**CORE PRINCIPLE: All permissions configurable in every combination**

**Default Role Hierarchy:**
- Sales Assistant (store staff) - Create
- Manager - Create, Approve, Edit, Send
- Upper Management - Create, Approve, Edit, Send, Cancel
- Director - All + Override

**Default Approval Process (configurable):**
```
STAFF CREATES → MANAGER APPROVES → UPPER MANAGEMENT APPROVES → SEND
```

**Permission Breakdown:**

**CREATE PO:**
- Sales Assistant: ✅ Can create
- Manager: ✅ Can create (also approves their own)
- Upper Management: ✅ Can create (also approves their own)
- Default: Any role can create, configurable per role

**EDIT PO:**
- DRAFT status: ✅ Anyone can edit (staff, manager, upper mgmt)
- PACKING status: ✅ Anyone can edit (add products, adjust qty)
- SENT status: ❌ Cannot edit (locked for sending)
- RECEIVED status: ✅ Can edit (add missing items, adjust received qty)

**SEND PO:**
- After approval: ✅ Creator or Manager can send
- Requires: Prior approval to complete
- Configurable: Can allow auto-send after final approval

**APPROVE PO:**
- Manager: ✅ Approves staff/lower-tier POs
- Upper Management: ✅ Approves all POs including manager-created
- Director: ✅ Approves all, can override thresholds
- Multi-tier: Staff → Manager → Upper Mgmt approval chain (default)

**RECEIVE PO:**
- Store Staff: ✅ Can receive at store
- Manager: ✅ Can receive
- Anyone: ✅ Can receive (configurable)

**AMEND PO:**
- Creator: ✅ Can amend in DRAFT/PACKING
- Manager: ✅ Can amend any PO in DRAFT/PACKING
- After SENT: ✅ Anyone can ADD PRODUCTS (new line items)
- During PACKING: ✅ Anyone can edit quantities/products

**CANCEL PO:**
- DRAFT only: ✅ Can cancel (staff, manager, upper mgmt)
- After SENT: ❌ Cannot cancel (mark as RECEIVED instead)
- Director override: ✅ Can cancel any PO at any status

**VIEW AUDIT TRAIL:**
- Everyone: ✅ Can view full audit trail (no restrictions)
- Shows: Who did what, when, why (rejection reason, amendment details)

**OVERRIDE APPROVALS:**
- Director: ✅ Can bypass any approval threshold
- Tech team: ✅ Can force status changes (for system issues)
- Other roles: ❌ Cannot override

**Configuration Admin Panel (Required):**
- Allow per-supplier override of standard roles
- Allow per-product-category override
- Allow per-user custom permissions
- Lock certain operations by status (SENT, RECEIVED)
- Audit log: Track all permission changes

## QUESTION 23: Multi-Tier Approval - Escalation & Timeout
**Category:** Business Logic - Approval Workflow
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** Consignment timing, escalation rules, SLAs

### The Question

How should pending approvals be handled?

1. **Approval timeout:**
   - Should POs auto-approve if not approved within X hours? (e.g., 24h, 48h, never)
   - Or should they auto-reject? Never auto-action?
   - Should different tiers have different timeouts? (lower $ faster approval)

2. **Escalation:**
   - If approval pending > 24h, should system notify next level manager?
   - Auto-escalate to director if manager doesn't respond? (timing?)
   - Email reminders every X hours? (6h, 24h, or not at all)

3. **Visibility:**
   - Should pending POs show on dashboard for approvers?
   - Sort by: Oldest first? Highest value first? Urgency?
   - Batch approval? (approve multiple at once)

4. **SLA tracking:**
   - Should system track "time in approval"?
   - Report on: Average approval time? Slow approvers?
   - Or not critical?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Auto-Approval: NEVER**
- No auto-approve timeouts (approvals must be explicit)
- Forces accountability and prevents accidental approvals

**Dashboard Visibility:**
- ✅ Show pending POs on dashboard for all approvers
- Sort by: Oldest first (most urgent), then highest value
- Show: PO #, supplier, value, created date, pending since when, who created it
- Color-coding: Yellow (pending 1-5 days), Red (pending > 5 days)
- Batch approval: ✅ Allow select multiple + "Approve All" button

**Email Reminders:**
- ✅ Email sent when PO first needs approval (immediate)
- ✅ Reminder emails: Every 24 hours if still pending
- Content: PO details, link to approve, "Pending for X days"

**Manual Escalation (Staff Initiated):**
- ✅ Staff can REQUEST escalation if pending > 24 hours
- Button on PO: "Request Escalation to Manager" (visible to creator if pending 24h+)
- Escalation: Moves approval request UP chain (staff approval → manager, manager approval → upper mgmt)
- Sends: Email to next level + notification to current approver ("Staff requested escalation")
- Purpose: Prevents bottleneck without removing approver responsibility

**Escalation Management:**
- Cannot auto-escalate (prevents bypassing approvers)
- Only manual escalation when staff requests (configurable per supplier/threshold)
- Track: Who escalated, when, original approver, new approver
- Report on: Most escalated POs, most escalated suppliers, approval time metrics

**SLA Tracking:**
- ✅ Track time-in-approval per PO
- ✅ Report: Average approval time by role, by supplier, by value tier
- Dashboard metric: "Avg approval time: 2.4 hours"
- Alert: If average approval time > 24 hours, notify management

## QUESTION 24: Multi-Tier Approval - Rejection & Resubmission
**Category:** Business Logic - Workflow Edge Cases
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** Amendment cycle, compliance, audit trail

### The Question

What happens when a PO is **rejected** by an approver?

1. **Rejection flow:**
   - PO returns to: DRAFT status? New REJECTED status?
   - Approver can provide: Rejection reason? (required or optional?)
   - Can include: Suggested changes/corrections?

2. **Resubmission:**
   - Can staff resubmit immediately or wait X hours?
   - Does it go back to same approver or different approver?
   - Should it be a new approval cycle or different process?

3. **Rejection reasons (if tracked):**
   - Should system capture: "Over budget", "Missing info", "Wrong supplier", custom reason?
   - Should this be reported/analyzed? (most common rejection reasons)
   - Dashboard show: "Rejected POs" count?

4. **Audit trail:**
   - Should rejection be logged? (who rejected, when, reason)
   - Should this appear on PO history? (visible to all staff)
   - Or only to approvers?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Rejection Status: CANCELED (new status, not back to DRAFT)**
- New status: `CANCELED` (distinct from DRAFT, allows resubmit window)
- Status flow: PENDING_APPROVAL → CANCELED (if rejected)
- Visual indicator: Red "CANCELED" badge on PO

**Rejection Reason:**
- ✅ Reason field is OPTIONAL (approver doesn't have to provide one)
- ✅ Pre-determined dropdown options for reason:
  - "Over budget"
  - "Missing information"
  - "Wrong supplier"
  - "Duplicate PO"
  - "Quantity issue"
  - "Timing issue"
  - "Need clarification"
  - "Other (approver notes)"
- Optional text field: Approver can add custom notes if selected "Other"

**Resubmission Window:**
- ✅ CANCELED PO can be resubmitted within 7 days of cancellation
- Resubmit button: Visible only within 7-day window
- After 7 days: PO becomes archived, must create new PO
- Resubmit flow: Returns to PENDING_APPROVAL (new approval cycle, same chain)
- Resubmitted goes to: Same approver first (unless escalated)
- Changes allowed before resubmit: Can edit quantities, products, etc. during CANCELED status

**Audit Trail:**
- ✅ Full audit trail visible to ALL STAFF (not just approvers)
- Logged information:
  - Who rejected
  - When rejected
  - Rejection reason (if provided)
  - Approver notes (if "Other")
  - Who resubmitted
  - When resubmitted
  - Timeline: Days between rejection and resubmit
- PO History tab: Shows all rejections, resubmits, approvals (complete lifecycle)

**Dashboard & Reporting:**
- Rejected POs counter: "X POs rejected this week"
- Report: Most common rejection reasons (track trends)
- Report: Most rejected suppliers (quality issues?)
- Report: Average rejection rate by approver
- Visibility: Show on creator's dashboard as "Action Required" if within 7-day resubmit window

## QUESTION 25: Multi-Tier Approval - Notifications & Communication
**Category:** Business Logic - Notifications & UX
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** User experience, email volume, compliance

### The Question

How should approvers be **notified** about pending approvals?

1. **Approval notifications:**
   - Email immediately when PO pending approval?
   - Or dashboard alert only?
   - Both?

2. **Email content:**
   - Should email include: PO details (supplier, items, value)?
   - Or just: "Action required - click to review"?
   - Level of detail?

3. **Approval reminders:**
   - If pending approval > 24h, send reminder email?
   - How many reminders? (every 24h? once at 24h? 3x?)
   - To same approver or escalate to manager?

4. **Rejection notifications:**
   - If PO rejected, notify: Creator? Manager? Finance?
   - Include: Rejection reason and next steps?

5. **Batch notifications:**
   - Should system batch emails? (e.g., "You have 5 POs pending approval")
   - Or individual emails per PO?

6. **Opt-in/opt-out:**
   - Should each user be able to disable approval emails?
   - Or all staff must receive them?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Email Recipients:**
- ✅ Email sent to: All managers who need to approve
- Get email from: `users` table `email` column (manager's registered email)
- Immediate: Send email immediately when PO needs approval

**Email Content (Full Details):**
- ✅ Include FULL PO details in email:
  - PO #, Supplier, Date created
  - All items: SKU, Name, Qty, Unit Price, Total per line
  - Total value (with GST)
  - Created by: Staff member name
  - Status: Pending Manager Approval
- ✅ Include clickable link: "View & Approve" (links to CIS approval page)
- Professional formatting: HTML email with logo

**Reminder Emails:**
- ✅ If pending > 24 hours: Send reminder email
- Frequency: Every 24 hours while still pending (daily reminders)
- Content: Same as initial + "Pending for X days now - please review"
- Continue reminding: Until approved, rejected, or escalated

**Rejection Notifications:**
- ✅ Notify: Creator of the PO (staff member)
- Content: "Your PO #12345 was rejected by Manager Name"
- Include: Rejection reason dropdown value
- Include: Link to view PO and resubmit
- Also include: Approver's optional notes (if "Other" was selected)

**No Batch Emails (Real-time Per-PO):**
- ✅ NO batching necessary
- Each PO triggers individual email immediately
- Reason: Approvals need immediate visibility (not delayed)

**Queue System Integration:**
- ✅ Add to queue: `functions/vapeshed-website.php` queue function (bottom of file)
- Queue method: Use existing queue system for email sending
- Async processing: Emails sent via background queue (don't block page load)
- Retry logic: Use existing queue retry mechanism if email fails
- Database log: Track email sent timestamp, delivery status

**Email Configuration:**
- Not opt-out (all managers must receive approval emails)
- Cannot be disabled (required for workflow)
- But: Can customize recipient list (who is "manager" role)

## QUESTION 26: Email Notifications - When & To Whom
**Category:** Communication - Notification Rules
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** User experience, audit trail, supplier communication

### The Question

When should **emails be sent** and to **whom**?

**Potential events that trigger emails:**

1. **DRAFT created:**
   - Email to: Creator? Manager? Finance?
   - Content: "Consignment drafted by John Smith"?

2. **DRAFT sent to supplier:**
   - Email to: Supplier? Creator? Manager? Finance?
   - Content: Full PO details or summary?

3. **PO approved (if using approvals):**
   - Email to: Creator? Manager? Approver? Supplier?
   - Content: "Approved and sent to supplier"?

4. **PO received at store:**
   - Email to: Creator? Store manager? Finance? Supplier?
   - Content: Items received, quantities, date/time?

5. **PO amended after SENT:**
   - Email to: Supplier? Approver? Finance?
   - Content: "Amendment received, items X changed"?

6. **Photo uploaded (if enabled):**
   - Email to: Manager? Finance? Or no email?
   - Content: Link to photos or just notification?

7. **Over-receipt detected:**
   - Email to: Manager? Finance? Approver?
   - Content: "Received more than ordered - approval needed?"

8. **GRNI generated & sent to Xero:**
   - Email to: Finance? Supplier? Manager?
   - Content: "GRNI #12345 generated, link to download"?

**Questions:**
- Which events should trigger emails? (all above, or just key ones?)
- Should emails be: Real-time or daily digest?
- Should users be able to mute/opt-out of certain emails?
- Should system track "email sent" in audit log?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Email Configuration: ALL CONFIGURABLE, NONE BY DEFAULT**

**Core Principle:**
- No emails triggered by default (clean slate)
- Admin can enable/disable any email event
- Create per-event configuration rules
- Each event: Who gets notified? (configurable recipients)

**Configurable Events:**
1. **DRAFT created**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Creator, Manager, Finance, Specific role, Specific user

2. **DRAFT sent to supplier**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Supplier (from contact table), Creator, Manager, Finance

3. **PO approved**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Creator, Manager, Approver, Supplier, Finance

4. **PO received at store**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Creator, Store manager, Finance, Supplier

5. **PO amended after SENT**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Supplier, Approver, Finance, Creator

6. **Photo uploaded**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Manager, Finance, Creator, Specific role

7. **Over-receipt detected**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Manager, Finance, Approver, Creator

8. **GRNI generated & sent to Xero**
   - Disabled by default
   - Can enable → Send to: Finance, Supplier, Manager, Creator

**Admin Configuration Panel (Required):**
- Toggle each event on/off
- For each enabled event:
  - Select recipients (checkboxes): Creator, Manager, Finance Lead, Supplier, Specific user
  - Select timing: Real-time or daily digest
  - Select email template (can customize content)
  - Add custom recipients by email address
  - Enable/disable per supplier (e.g., some suppliers get emails, others don't)
  - Enable/disable per store/outlet

**Email Delivery:**
- Real-time: Send immediately when event occurs
- Digest: Batch daily at X time (e.g., 9am, 5pm) with all events from past 24h
- Mixed: Some events real-time, others digest (configurable per event)

**Audit Logging:**
- ✅ Track "email sent": Who, when, event type, recipients, status (success/failure)
- ✅ Log stored in: emails_log table (for compliance/troubleshooting)
- ✅ Dashboard: Show "Emails sent this month: X" metrics

**Safety & Defaults:**
- Start conservative: Nothing enabled
- Reduce email fatigue: Users only get what they need
- Flexibility: Can tweak as organization learns what works best
- Per-supplier rules: High-volume suppliers can have different email rules than low-volume

## QUESTION 27: Email Templates & Content
**Category:** Communication - Email Design
**Complexity:** Low
**Affects:** User experience, compliance, professionalism

### The Question

What should **email templates** look like?

**Current available data in emails:**
- PO number, date, supplier name
- Items ordered (SKU, name, qty, unit price, total)
- Store name/location
- Staff member name
- Total value + GST
- Status (DRAFT, SENT, RECEIVED, etc)
- Links to: View PO online, Approve PO, View photos

**Template design questions:**

1. **Tone & style:**
   - Professional/formal?
   - Casual/friendly?
   - Branded with Vape Shed logo?

2. **Content detail:**
   - Full PO details (all items)?
   - Summary only (total, count of items)?
   - Expandable sections (click to see details)?

3. **Call-to-action buttons:**
   - "View in CIS" button?
   - "Approve" button (if applicable)?
   - "Download PO" PDF link?

4. **Supplier emails:**
   - Different template than internal emails?
   - Include supplier contact info?
   - Delivery address details?

5. **Customization:**
   - Should templates be editable by admin?
   - Or locked to system defaults?
   - Per-supplier template variations?

6. **Footer:**
   - Include company contact info?
   - Help desk link?
   - Unsubscribe option?
   - Privacy notice?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Two professional responsive HTML email templates (production-ready), based on purchase-orders.php modern design:**

#### **Template 1: Internal Staff Email** (Created/Approved/GRNI notifications)

**Design Pattern:**
- **Header:** Black background (#000000) with Vape Shed logo (80px height)
- **Accent bar:** Yellow (#ffcc00) - Vape Shed brand color
- **Width:** 600px fixed (mobile scales to 100%)
- **Layout:** Table-based (email-client safe: Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- **Technology:** Inline CSS only, VML fallback for Outlook, no external resources

**Content Structure:**
```
[Logo + "Consignment Notification" title]
[Yellow accent bar]

[Event summary box]
  - Event type (Created/Approved/Received)
  - Consignment #
  - Date/time
  - Staff member name

[Key details card]
  - Supplier name + contact
  - Store location
  - Total items / total value
  - Status badge (color-coded)

[Product table] (if ≤ 20 items; otherwise: "20+ items")
  - Column headers: SKU | Name | Qty | Unit Price | Total
  - Striped rows (alt row: #f5f5f5)
  - Bold total row

[Call-to-action buttons]
  - Primary: "View in CIS" (yellow button, links to CIS consignment detail)
  - Secondary: "Download PDF" (gray button)

[Footer]
  - Ecigdis Limited header
  - Company address: 419 Grey Street, Hamilton East 3216
  - Phone: [from config]
  - Support email: support@vapeshed.co.nz
  - GST/NZBN: [from config]
  - Copyright © 2025 Ecigdis Limited
  - Small text: "This is an automated notification. Do not reply to this email."
```

**Security:** All user data escaped with `htmlspecialchars(ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')`

**Implementation:**
```php
function generate_consignment_email_html(
    $consignmentID, $eventType, $staffName, $created,
    $supplierName, $supplierID, $storeName, $itemCount,
    $totalValue, $status, $itemsHTML,
    $logoURL = 'https://www.vapeshed.co.nz/assets/template/vapeshed/images/vape-shed-logo.png',
    $cisURL = 'https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz',
    $companyName = 'Ecigdis Limited',
    $addrLine1 = '419 Grey Street', $addrSuburb = 'Hamilton East', $addrPostal = '3216',
    $addrCity = 'Hamilton', $supportEmail = 'support@vapeshed.co.nz'
)
// Use design pattern from purchase-orders.php lines 1410-1568
```

#### **Template 2: Supplier Email** (SENT to supplier notifications)

**Design Pattern:** Same as Template 1, but:
- **Header title:** "Purchase Order" instead of "Consignment Notification"
- **Remove:** Store location (not needed for supplier)
- **Add:** "Delivery address" section with outlet details + postcode
- **Add:** "Please confirm receipt" language in CTA button
- **CTA button color:** Green (#00aa44) instead of yellow (indicates action needed)
- **Footer:** Include PO reference number prominently
- **Tone:** Slight formality increase ("Kindly confirm receipt of this purchase order...")

**Key differences from internal:**
- Full delivery address visible
- No staff member name shown
- "Expected delivery date" shown if available
- Confirmation link instead of CIS link
- Contact info shows supplier contact, not CIS support
- No "Download PDF" button (show "View Online" instead)

#### **Customization Strategy:**

**Locked (NO customization):**
- Color scheme (black header, yellow accents)
- Company branding (logo, GST/NZBN)
- Footer structure
- Security escaping patterns

**Configurable via Admin UI:**
- Company logo URL (upload to replace default)
- Support email address
- Company address lines
- Phone number
- Company name
- "From" email address sender name

**Per-Supplier Variations (optional, LOW priority):**
- Can be added later if needed (store custom template per supplier_id)
- For now: Use standard template for all suppliers

**Template Content Detail:**
- **Full items:** ✅ Show all items (≤500 per PO recommended)
- **If > 20 items:** Show first 10 + "...and 15 more items" + link to view all
- **Summary mode:** Off (always show details - business requirement)

**Expandable Sections:**
- Not needed (inline CSS limitation for email clients)
- All content shown expanded (static HTML)

---

**Specification Lock:**

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Template engine** | Raw PHP (no Blade/Twig - email compatibility) |
| **Responsive** | Yes (600px fixed width, mobile scales) |
| **Color scheme** | Black header + yellow accent (branded) |
| **Font** | Arial/Helvetica (email-safe fallback) |
| **Button style** | Solid colors with VML Outlook support |
| **Data escaping** | htmlspecialchars(ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') everywhere |
| **Customization** | Configurable (URL, email, address, phone, name) |
| **Admin template editor** | NO (locked design, just variable values) |
| **Per-supplier override** | Optional enhancement (not MVP) |
| **Unsubscribe** | NO (internal system - not required) |
| **Footer** | Full company info + GST/NZBN + trademark |

## QUESTION 28: Email Notifications - Digest vs Real-time
**Category:** Communication - Delivery Strategy
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** User experience, notification volume, system load

### The Question

How should emails be **delivered**?

**Option 1: Real-time (immediate)**
- Send email immediately when event occurs
- Pros: Users see action right away
- Cons: May cause email overload (5-10 emails/day per user)

**Option 2: Digest (batched)**
- Collect events for X hours (e.g., 8h, 24h)
- Send one email summarizing all events
- Pros: Less email volume
- Cons: Users might miss urgent items

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Real-time for: Urgent items (rejections, over-receipt, errors)
- Digest for: Routine items (confirmations, approvals)
- Pros: Balance urgency and volume
- Cons: More complex to implement

**Your preference:**
1. Which strategy? (real-time, digest, hybrid)
2. If digest: How often? (4h, 8h, 24h intervals?)
3. If hybrid: Which events are "urgent"?
4. Should users control this? (prefer digest vs real-time per email type?)

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Strategy: HYBRID with configurable real-time/digest per event type**

#### **High Priority (Real-time immediate) - Send NOW:**
- **Rejections** - PO rejected by approver (staff/finance MUST know immediately to resubmit)
- **Approval requests** - New PO awaiting approval (approver needs to act)
- **System errors** - Integration failures, photo upload failures, barcode scan failures (tech intervention needed)
- **Budget alerts** - PO exceeds configured threshold without override (finance escalation needed)
- **Over-receipts detected** - Receiving qty > PO qty (compliance issue)

**Implementation:** Send immediately via email queue system

#### **Medium Priority (Real-time via batching) - Send at intervals:**
- **PO confirmations** (created, sent)
- **PO received** (GRNI completed)
- **Status changes** (approved, scheduled)

**Implementation:** Queue for batching (batch every 30 minutes or at 5 item threshold, whichever comes first)

#### **Low Priority (Daily digest) - Batch daily at 8 AM:**
- **Routine notifications** (PO created by colleague, etc.)
- **System info** (daily summary of all activity)

**Implementation:** Queue for batching (batch daily at 8 AM NZ time, or when 20+ items batched)

---

#### **Delivery Queue System (Uses existing vapeshed connection):**

**Queue Structure:**
```sql
-- Email queue table (existing pattern from vapeshed-website.php)
email_queue
  - id (INT, auto-increment, PK)
  - event_type (VARCHAR: 'po_rejection', 'approval_request', 'po_confirmation', etc.)
  - priority (TINYINT: 1=immediate, 2=batched_30min, 3=daily_digest)
  - recipient_email (VARCHAR)
  - recipient_id (INT, FK to users)
  - subject (VARCHAR)
  - html_body (LONGTEXT)
  - data_json (JSON - full event data for audit)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - scheduled_send_at (TIMESTAMP - when to send)
  - sent_at (TIMESTAMP, NULL until sent)
  - status (ENUM: 'pending', 'sent', 'failed', 'skipped')
  - retry_count (INT, default 0)
  - error_message (TEXT)
  - created_by (INT, FK to users)
  - INDEX (priority, scheduled_send_at, status)
  - INDEX (recipient_email, created_at)
```

**Queue Processing (Cron jobs):**

1. **Immediate Queue Processor** (every 1 minute)
   ```php
   // Process all priority=1 items immediately
   // Connect via vapeshed connection
   // Send email via sendGrid/Postmark/native mail()
   // Update sent_at, status='sent'
   // Retry up to 3 times if failed
   ```

2. **Batched Queue Processor** (every 30 minutes)
   ```php
   // Collect all priority=2 items created in last 30 min
   // Group by recipient_email
   // Generate batch digest email
   // Queue for sending
   // Mark items as batched
   ```

3. **Daily Digest Processor** (8 AM NZ time daily)
   ```php
   // Collect all priority=3 items created since yesterday 8 AM
   // Group by recipient_email
   // Generate daily summary email
   // Send to each recipient
   // Archive processed items
   ```

---

#### **User Preference Configuration:**

**Admin UI Settings (per user role/individual):**

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **PO rejection emails** | Real-time OR None | Real-time |
| **Approval request emails** | Real-time OR None | Real-time |
| **Error notification emails** | Real-time OR Digest | Real-time |
| **PO confirmation emails** | Real-time OR Digest OR None | Digest (batched 30min) |
| **Daily digest emails** | Yes OR No | Yes (8 AM) |
| **Unsubscribe from digests** | Yes OR No | No |

**Configuration table:**
```sql
user_email_preferences
  - user_id (INT, PK, FK to users)
  - po_rejection (ENUM: 'realtime', 'none')
  - approval_request (ENUM: 'realtime', 'none')
  - error_notification (ENUM: 'realtime', 'digest')
  - po_confirmation (ENUM: 'realtime', 'digest', 'none')
  - daily_digest (BOOL)
  - updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

---

#### **Specification Lock:**

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Strategy** | Hybrid (urgent=real-time, routine=batched, low=digest) |
| **Immediate events** | Rejections, approvals, errors, budget alerts, over-receipts |
| **Batched interval** | 30 minutes (max wait time) or 5 items (trigger) |
| **Daily digest time** | 8 AM NZ time (NZDT/NZST) |
| **Queue system** | Uses existing vapeshed DB connection |
| **Retry logic** | 3 retries with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min) |
| **Max batch size** | 50 items per digest email |
| **User preference** | Configurable per role, defaults set |
| **Unsubscribe** | Digest-only (urgent emails cannot be unsubscribed) |
| **Archive period** | 30 days (then move to archive table) |

## QUESTION 29: Exception Notifications & Escalation
**Category:** Communication - Exception Handling
**Complexity:** High
**Affects:** Error handling, compliance, incident management

### The Question

What about **error/exception notifications**?

**Potential exceptions that might need emails:**

1. **System errors:**
   - Xero sync failed → Email: Finance? Tech team?
   - Lightspeed API timeout → Email: Who?
   - PDF generation failed → Email: Who?
   - Photo upload failed → Email: Staff or manager?

2. **Business exceptions:**
   - Over-receipt detected → Email: Manager? Finance? Approver?
   - Price mismatch between PO and invoice → Email: Finance?
   - Supplier not found in system → Email: Manager?
   - Barcode scan failed → Email: Staff? Manager?

3. **Approval exceptions:**
   - Approval timeout → Email: Escalate to director?
   - Rejected 3x times → Email: Escalate to manager?
   - Budget exceeded without override → Email: Finance?

4. **Escalation:**
   - Should system automatically escalate exceptions?
   - To whom? (manager, director, finance team, tech team?)
   - How many times? (once, or repeat every X hours?)
   - Should there be a "critical" alert level? (SMS, Slack, app notification in addition to email?)

5. **Non-exception notifications:**
   - Should system send success emails? (PO created, PO sent, PO received)
   - Or just error/exception emails?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Exception Handling Framework: Tiered escalation with automatic routing + manual override**

#### **Exception Categories & Routing:**

**TIER 1: System Errors (Immediate alert to Tech Team)**
- **Error:** Xero API sync failed 3x
  - **Who:** Tech team email list (config)
  - **When:** After 3rd retry (backoff: 1min, 5min, 15min)
  - **Template:** "Sync failure - Consignment #XYZ - Xero error 403"
  - **Data:** Stack trace, last request/response, retry history
  - **Action item:** Manual retry button in admin panel

- **Error:** Lightspeed API timeout (no response after 30s)
  - **Who:** Tech team email list (config)
  - **When:** Immediately after timeout
  - **Template:** "API timeout - Lightspeed - Consignment #XYZ"
  - **Action:** Manual sync button in admin panel
  - **Retry:** System auto-retries every 5 min for 1 hour

- **Error:** PDF generation failed (HTML→PDF conversion error)
  - **Who:** Tech team email list (config)
  - **When:** After 3 retries
  - **Template:** "PDF generation failed - Consignment #XYZ"
  - **Action:** Manual PDF regenerate button

- **Error:** Photo upload failed (S3/cloud storage error)
  - **Who:** Staff member (who initiated upload) + manager
  - **When:** After 3 retries
  - **Template:** "Photo upload failed - Manual retry available"
  - **Action:** Re-upload button in UI

**TIER 2: Business Exceptions (Alert to Finance/Approvers)**
- **Exception:** Over-receipt detected (received qty > PO qty)
  - **Who:** Approver (who approved PO) + Finance team
  - **When:** On GRNI entry (real-time)
  - **Template:** "Over-receipt alert - Consignment #XYZ - Qty: PO=100, received=105"
  - **Data:** Variance qty, variance %, original PO details
  - **Action:** Requires manual review + comment ("why was over-quantity received?")
  - **Escalation:** If no review within 24h, remind finance again

- **Exception:** Price mismatch between PO and invoice
  - **Who:** Finance team
  - **When:** On invoice/GRNI matching
  - **Template:** "Price mismatch - Consignment #XYZ - PO $1000, Invoice $1050"
  - **Data:** PO total, invoice total, variance %, variance $
  - **Action:** Manual approval or request amendment from supplier
  - **Threshold:** Only alert if variance > $50 OR > 5% (configurable)

- **Exception:** Supplier not found in Lightspeed/Xero
  - **Who:** Manager + Tech team
  - **When:** During PO creation/send (blocking error)
  - **Template:** "Supplier mismatch - Supplier 'XYZ' not found in Lightspeed"
  - **Action:** Create supplier, then retry
  - **Manual override:** Allow proceed (mark as manual approval)

- **Exception:** Barcode scan failed or invalid
  - **Who:** Staff member (who scanned)
  - **When:** Immediately on scan attempt
  - **Template:** "Barcode invalid - Scanned: 'ABC123' - Not found in PO"
  - **Action:** Manual entry or skip + comment
  - **No escalation:** Staff can handle without manager approval

**TIER 3: Approval Process Exceptions (Alert to Approvers + Escalate)**
- **Exception:** PO approval timeout (pending > 7 days)
  - **Day 7:** First reminder to approver
  - **Day 10:** Escalate to next manager up
  - **Day 14:** Escalate to director + mark as "needs executive attention"
  - **Who:** Approver (day 7) → Manager (day 10) → Director (day 14)
  - **Template:** "Approval pending for 7 days - PO #XYZ awaiting your action"
  - **Action:** Approve/Reject button in email (single-click)

- **Exception:** PO rejected 3x times in a row
  - **After 3rd rejection:** Alert manager + original requester
  - **Who:** Manager + PO creator
  - **When:** After 3rd rejection
  - **Template:** "PO #XYZ rejected 3 times - Manual review required"
  - **Data:** Rejection reasons from each attempt
  - **Action:** Manager + tech to investigate issue pattern (bad data? integration issue?)
  - **Escalation:** If pattern continues (rejected 5x), escalate to director

- **Exception:** Budget exceeded without override
  - **Who:** Finance team + Manager
  - **When:** Real-time when PO total > budget threshold
  - **Template:** "Budget alert - PO #XYZ exceeds approved budget: $XYZ available, $ABC requested"
  - **Threshold:** Configurable per supplier (default $5000)
  - **Action:** Approve exception OR require budget adjustment
  - **Escalation:** If exception > $10,000 (or configurable), escalate to director

---

#### **Escalation Rules (Automatic):**

**Time-based escalation:**
```
Day 1: Approver gets email
Day 7: Manager gets reminder email (approver still has action)
Day 10: Director gets alert (escalate approval authority)
Day 14: Director can force-approve/reject
Day 21: Auto-cancel PO (if not resolved)
```

**Retry-based escalation:**
```
Attempt 1: Alert to initial handler
Attempt 3: Escalate to next level
Attempt 5: Escalate to next level
Attempt 7: Escalate to director (critical)
Attempt 10: Manual intervention required (stop auto-retries)
```

**Severity-based escalation:**
```
Minor (< $500): Handler only
Major ($500-$2000): Handler + Manager
Critical (> $2000): Handler + Manager + Director + Finance
System-critical: Tech team + Director
```

---

#### **Exception Queue & Dashboard:**

**New admin panel: "Exception Dashboard"**
```
Shows:
- All open exceptions (sorted by age)
- Pending approvals (sorted by deadline)
- Failed syncs (ready for manual retry)
- Over-receipts (awaiting review)
- Price mismatches (awaiting decision)

Each exception shows:
- Status (new, acknowledged, in-progress, resolved)
- Age (days pending)
- Assigned to (person responsible)
- Manual action buttons (retry, approve, reject, override, snooze)
- Comments section (audit trail)
```

#### **Specification Lock:**

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **System errors** | Alert tech team after 3 retries |
| **Business exceptions** | Real-time alert to responsible party |
| **Approval timeout** | Escalate: Day 7→Manager, Day 10→Director, Day 14→Auto-cancel |
| **Rejection pattern** | Alert after 3 consecutive rejections |
| **Budget exceed** | Alert finance immediately, require manual override |
| **Over-receipt** | Alert approver + finance immediately |
| **Price mismatch** | Alert finance if > $50 OR > 5% variance |
| **Escalation method** | Email primary, dashboard secondary |
| **Retry logic** | Exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min, 1h, 4h) |
| **Max retries** | 10 attempts, then manual intervention |
| **SMS alerts** | NO (email sufficient for CIS) |
| **Slack integration** | Optional enhancement (not MVP) |
| **Manual override** | Available for all exceptions (audit logged) |
| **Exception archive** | 90 days retention (then archive) |

## QUESTION 30: Integration Timing & Sequencing
**Category:** Integration - Data Sync Strategy
**Complexity:** High
**Affects:** Data consistency, performance, reliability

### The Question

How should **integrations happen** and in what **order**?

**Current integrations:**
1. Lightspeed Consignment creation/update
2. Xero bill generation (for GRNI)
3. Freight API for weight/volume calculation
4. Photo upload to cloud storage
5. Barcode scanning (local)
6. Email sending

**Timing questions:**

1. **When status changes (e.g., DRAFT → SENT):**
   - Should ALL integrations happen synchronously (wait for all to complete)?
   - Or should they happen asynchronously (background queue)?
   - Or hybrid (sync for critical, async for non-critical)?

2. **If integration fails:**
   - Should the status change still complete? (e.g., mark as SENT even if Xero sync fails)
   - Or should it rollback? (keep as DRAFT if Lightspeed sync fails)
   - Or queue for retry? (mark as SENT, retry Xero every 5 min for 24h)

3. **Sequence order (if multiple integrations):**
   - Should Lightspeed sync FIRST? (ensure Lightspeed has updated data before Xero)
   - Or Xero first? (ensure invoice created before photos attached?)
   - Or does order not matter?

4. **Partial success:**
   - If Lightspeed succeeds but Xero fails, is that OK?
   - Should we "eventually consistent" (sync data over time) or "immediately consistent" (all or nothing)?

5. **Retry logic:**
   - If sync fails, retry how many times? (3? 5? unlimited?)
   - Backoff strategy? (immediate, 5 min wait, exponential backoff?)
   - Should user be notified of failures? (email, dashboard alert, both?)

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Strategy: HYBRID with critical-path synchronous + non-critical asynchronous**

#### **Integration Sequence & Timing by Event:**

**EVENT: Create Consignment (DRAFT → Save)**
```
Sequence:
1. Save to local DB (consignments table)
   - Status: DRAFT
   - Return: Consignment ID to user
   - User can immediately upload photos, edit

2. Background queue (async, fire-and-forget):
   - Generate preview PDF (for download)
   - Validate data for Lightspeed (but don't sync yet)
   - Index for search

Timing: Synchronous (< 500ms) - user sees immediate feedback
User experience: "Consignment created - ID: #12345. Upload photos now."
```

**EVENT: Send Consignment (DRAFT → SENT)**
```
Sequence:
1. SYNCHRONOUS (Critical path):
   a. Validate all required data (weights, volumes, supplier, items)
   b. Sync to Lightspeed (create consignment order)
      - If fails: STOP, show error, keep DRAFT, queue for retry
      - If succeeds: Continue
   c. Generate final PDF
   d. Update status to SENT
   e. Commit DB transaction

   Timing: < 3 seconds (wait for user to see confirmation)
   User sees: "Consignment sent to Lightspeed" (success page with ID)

2. ASYNCHRONOUS (Background queue, fire-and-forget):
   - Sync to Xero (create bill)
      - Retry: Every 5 min for 24 hours
      - On failure: Alert finance team
   - Send email notifications
   - Upload photos to cloud
   - Generate label if freight selected

Timing: Start immediately, complete within 1-2 hours
User sees: Email when all complete ("All documents ready to download")
```

**EVENT: Receive Consignment (SENT → RECEIVED / GRNI)**
```
Sequence:
1. SYNCHRONOUS (Critical path):
   a. Validate received quantities (compare to PO)
   b. Check for over-receipts / under-receipts
   c. Update consignment status to RECEIVED
   d. Generate GRNI record
   e. Commit DB transaction

   Timing: < 1 second
   User sees: "Consignment marked as received"

2. ASYNCHRONOUS (Background queue):
   - Sync to Xero (create bill/invoice if not already done)
   - Sync to Lightspeed (mark received)
   - Generate receipt PDF
   - Send GRNI confirmation email
   - Archive photos
   - Flag for audit if over-receipt > 5%

Timing: Start immediately, complete within 1 hour
```

---

#### **Integration Failure Handling:**

**Strategy: "Optimistic commit" + eventual consistency**

**What this means:**
- User-facing status changes commit to DB immediately (SENT, RECEIVED, etc.)
- External system syncs are queued for background retry
- System is "eventually consistent" (all systems sync within 24 hours)
- User never sees sync failures in normal workflow (only tech team sees in admin panel)

**Implementation:**

**Critical integrations (block user if fail):**
- Lightspeed sync (must succeed before status change completes)
- Local PDF generation (must succeed before download available)

**Non-critical integrations (don't block, retry async):**
- Xero sync (retry for 24h)
- Email send (retry for 24h)
- Photo upload (retry for 24h)
- Freight rate quotes (retry for 24h, show "pending" on UI)

**Partial success handling:**
```
Example: SENT event, Lightspeed succeeds but Xero fails

1. Lightspeed sync: ✅ Success
2. Start Xero sync: ❌ Failed (API timeout)
3. Status: ✅ Set to SENT (user sees success)
4. Queue: Add Xero retry to queue (retry every 5 min)
5. Notify: User sees "Consignment sent" (success)
6. Notify: Finance gets email after 1 hour if Xero still failing
7. Result: Consignment in Lightspeed immediately, in Xero within 24h
   (User doesn't wait or care - business process continues)
```

---

#### **Sequence Order (Critical Dependencies):**

**For SENT event:**
```
Order matters:
1. Lightspeed FIRST (ensure LS has order data before anything else)
   → Because: Lightspeed is primary inventory system
   → If Lightspeed fails, stop everything

2. Xero SECOND (after LS confirms)
   → Because: Xero invoice references LS order ID
   → If LS failed, Xero sync won't find order reference

3. Email/PDF/Storage LAST (after Lightspeed confirmed)
   → Because: These are informational
   → Can be retried independently if they fail

Sequence:
Lightspeed ✅
  ↓
Xero (async queue)
  ↓
Email (async queue)
  ↓
PDF (async queue)
  ↓
Photos (async queue)
```

**For RECEIVED event:**
```
Order matters:
1. Local DB FIRST (save RECEIVED status immediately)
   → Because: User needs immediate feedback
   → Because: Affects subsequent transactions

2. Lightspeed SECOND (mark as received in LS)
   → Because: Affects inventory in LS

3. Xero THIRD (update bill/invoice in Xero)
   → Because: References LS received status

4. Email/Audit LAST

Sequence:
Local DB ✅
  ↓
Lightspeed (async queue)
  ↓
Xero (async queue)
  ↓
Email (async queue)
  ↓
Audit log (async)
```

---

#### **Retry Logic & Backoff:**

**Exponential backoff strategy:**
```
Retry 1: Immediately (no wait)
Retry 2: After 1 minute
Retry 3: After 5 minutes
Retry 4: After 15 minutes
Retry 5: After 1 hour
Retry 6: After 4 hours
Retry 7: After 24 hours
Retry 8-10: Once per day (up to 3 days)
Max retries: 10 attempts over 72 hours
```

**When to retry vs alert:**
- After retry 3 (5 min mark): Still queued, user doesn't know
- After retry 5 (1 hour mark): Send first alert to responsible team
- After retry 7 (24 hour mark): Send urgent alert to manager/director
- After retry 10 (72 hours): Mark as "manual intervention required"

---

#### **User Notification Strategy:**

**During operation (in-browser):**
- User sees: "Sending to Lightspeed..." (spinner)
- If sync fails: "Error: Lightspeed sync failed. Please try again." (blocking)
- If async background tasks start: "Consignment sent. Finalizing... (check back in 5 min)"

**After operation:**
- Email confirmation: "All documents ready" (when all async tasks complete)
- Email alert: "Some integrations failed - Manual review needed" (if critical failures after retries)
- Dashboard alert: Badge showing "Pending: 3 items need attention" (if partial failures)

---

#### **Specification Lock:**

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Send event sync** | Lightspeed CRITICAL (blocking), others async |
| **Receive event sync** | Local DB CRITICAL (blocking), Lightspeed/Xero/Email async |
| **Partial success** | ✅ OK - Optimistic commit, retry async |
| **Failure handling** | Commit to DB, queue for retry, alert if repeated failures |
| **Max retries** | 10 attempts over 72 hours |
| **Backoff strategy** | Exponential (1min, 5min, 15min, 1h, 4h, 24h) |
| **Timeout duration** | 30 seconds per API call, then retry |
| **Critical timeout** | User sees error if > 5 seconds |
| **Async timeout** | No user impact (happens in background) |
| **User notification** | Email when complete, dashboard badge if partial failures |
| **Tech team alert** | Email after 1 hour if sync still failing |
| **Retry window** | 24 hours for non-critical, 3 days for critical |
| **Order sensitivity** | YES - Lightspeed → Xero → Others |
| **All-or-nothing support** | NO - Partial success is acceptable |
| **Transaction type** | Optimistic (commit first, sync second) |

## QUESTION 31: Data Validation & Sync Errors
**Category:** Integration - Error Handling
**Complexity:** High
**Affects:** Data quality, compliance, user experience

### The Question

What validation should happen **before syncing** to external systems?

**Pre-sync validation:**

1. **Lightspeed sync validation:**
   - Supplier exists in Lightspeed? (error if not)
   - Products exist in Lightspeed? (error if not, or create?)
   - Outlet exists in Lightspeed? (error if not)
   - Quantities reasonable? (warn if > 1000 units)

2. **Xero sync validation:**
   - Supplier bank account valid? (for payments)
   - Tax rate correct? (GST 15%?)
   - PO total reasonable? (> $0? < $999,999?)
   - Currency correct? (NZD?)

3. **Freight API validation:**
   - Weight provided? (warn if missing)
   - Dimensions provided? (warn if missing)
   - Container type valid? (check against allowed types)

4. **Error handling:**
   - If validation fails, should PO be blocked?
   - Or should it warn user but allow proceed?
   - Should it create a "needs review" flag?

5. **Data correction:**
   - If sync fails due to bad data, who fixes it?
   - Should system suggest corrections? (e.g., "Product SKU not found, did you mean XYZ?")
   - Should there be a manual override? (allow proceed despite validation errors)

6. **Audit trail:**
   - Should validation results be logged? (which fields failed, when, why)
   - Should failed syncs be reported to tech team?
   - Should users see validation history? (transparent or behind the scenes)

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Three-tier validation: Format → Existence → Business Rules**

#### **TIER 1: Format Validation (Client-side + Server-side)**

**Client-side (JavaScript, real-time):**
- Email: Valid email format (regex)
- Phone: Valid NZ phone (09 XXXX XXXX)
- Date: Valid date (not in past for delivery dates)
- Numbers: Valid integers/decimals for quantities/prices
- SKU: Not empty, max 50 chars
- Supplier name: Not empty, max 100 chars
- Show error immediately (prevent form submit)

**Server-side (PHP, before save):**
- Re-validate all client-side rules (never trust client)
- All fields present and non-empty (where required)
- Length limits enforced
- Special char escaping
- If fails: Return 400 Bad Request + error details

**Result if fails:** Block operation immediately, show error to user, no DB save

---

#### **TIER 2: Data Existence Validation (Pre-sync check)**

**Lightspeed validation (before SEND):**
```
Check:
1. Supplier exists in Lightspeed
   - Query: SELECT supplier_id FROM lightspeed_suppliers WHERE supplier_name = ?
   - If missing: ⚠️ WARN (yellow banner)
     "Supplier 'XYZ' not found in Lightspeed.
      Create supplier now? [Create] [Skip] [Cancel]"
   - If proceed: Create supplier in LS first, then continue

2. Outlet exists in Lightspeed
   - Query: SELECT outlet_id FROM lightspeed_outlets WHERE outlet_code = ?
   - If missing: ❌ BLOCK (red error)
     "Outlet 'Hamilton' not configured.
      Please contact tech team to map outlet to Lightspeed."
   - Can't proceed without this

3. All SKUs exist in Lightspeed
   - Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lightspeed_products
              WHERE product_code IN (?, ?, ?)
   - If any missing: ⚠️ WARN (yellow banner)
     "3 of 10 products not found in Lightspeed:
      SKU-001, SKU-002, SKU-003
      [View suggestions] [Skip] [Cancel]"
   - If click "View suggestions": Show "Did you mean?" list
   - If proceed: Mark items as "pending Lightspeed creation"

4. Quantities reasonable
   - If any qty > 1000: ⚠️ WARN (yellow banner)
     "Quantity 5000 units seems high. Confirm? [Yes] [Edit]"
   - If qty = 0: ❌ BLOCK (red error)
     "Quantity cannot be 0"
   - If any qty negative: ❌ BLOCK

Result: User must resolve WARNings (choose action), BLOCKs prevent save
```

**Xero validation (before GRNI):**
```
Check:
1. Supplier bank account on file
   - Query: SELECT bank_account FROM suppliers WHERE supplier_id = ?
   - If missing: ⚠️ WARN (yellow banner)
     "No bank account found for supplier 'XYZ'.
      Payment cannot be processed.
      [Add bank account] [Skip] [Cancel]"
   - If proceed: Payment flagged for manual review

2. Tax treatment correct
   - Check: Is GST applied correctly (15% for NZ suppliers)?
   - If missing or wrong: ⚠️ WARN
     "Tax rate appears incorrect (0% detected, expected 15%).
      Proceed? [Yes] [Edit] [Cancel]"

3. PO total in reasonable range
   - If total = $0: ❌ BLOCK ("Cannot have $0 PO")
   - If total > $999,999: ⚠️ WARN ("Large PO > $1M. Requires finance approval.")
   - If total < $10: ⚠️ WARN ("Very small PO ($10). Correct? [Yes] [Edit]")

4. Currency = NZD
   - If currency != 'NZD': ❌ BLOCK
     "Wrong currency detected. Must be NZD."

Result: Block $0 or wrong currency, warn on extreme amounts
```

**Freight API validation (before quote):**
```
Check:
1. Weight provided (if freight needed)
   - If weight = 0 OR weight > 100kg: ⚠️ WARN
     "Weight not provided or seems extreme (100kg).
      Freight quotes may be inaccurate.
      [Edit weight] [Continue anyway]"

2. Dimensions provided (for volume calculation)
   - If any dimension = 0: ⚠️ WARN
     "Dimensions incomplete.
      Volume calculation will be estimate.
      [Edit] [Use estimate]"

3. Container type valid
   - Query: SELECT * FROM freight_containers WHERE container_type = ?
   - If invalid: ❌ BLOCK ("Invalid container type. Choices: Small, Medium, Large, Pallet")

Result: Estimate if data incomplete, block if invalid
```

---

#### **TIER 3: Business Logic Validation (Approval time)**

**Before approving PO:**
```
Check:
1. Total budget check
   - Supplier monthly budget: $50,000
   - Already spent: $40,000
   - This PO: $15,000
   - Result: ⚠️ WARN ("PO exceeds budget by $5K. Needs finance approval.")

2. Approval authority check
   - Approver can approve up to: $10,000
   - This PO: $15,000
   - Result: ❌ BLOCK ("You can only approve up to $10,000.
             Escalate to manager for approval.")

3. Duplicate check
   - Check: Any PO for same supplier in last 7 days with same items?
   - If match > 90%: ⚠️ WARN ("Similar PO created 2 days ago.
             Did you mean to amend instead?
             [View similar] [Continue anyway]")

Result: Warn on budget exceed, block on auth exceed, flag duplicates
```

---

#### **Error Handling Strategy:**

**When validation fails:**

**SCENARIO 1: Format error (client input wrong)**
```
Action: Block form submission
Message: "Please fix errors: Email format invalid, Quantity required"
User sees: Inline errors on form fields
Next step: User corrects and resubmits
Tech notification: None
```

**SCENARIO 2: Warning (proceed at user's risk)**
```
Example: "Supplier not in Lightspeed"
Action: Show yellow banner with options
Options: [Create], [Skip], [Cancel]
If Create: Auto-create supplier first, then continue
If Skip: Mark as "pending Lightspeed creation", continue
If Cancel: Don't proceed
Result: User chooses action, continues or not
Audit: Log which option user chose + timestamp
```

**SCENARIO 3: Block (can't proceed)**
```
Example: "Outlet not configured"
Action: Show red error, block operation
Message: Include "Contact tech team" link
Next step: Tech team must add mapping, then retry
Tech notification: Automatic alert (if many blocks occur)
```

**SCENARIO 4: Sync fails after validation passed**
```
Example: Validation passed, but Lightspeed API returned 404 for outlet
Action:
  1. Catch exception from Lightspeed API call
  2. Log full error (request, response, stack trace)
  3. Queue for retry (exponential backoff)
  4. Show user: "Sync temporarily failed. Retrying in background."
  5. Send tech team email if > 3 retries fail
Audit: Log sync attempt + error + retry count
```

---

#### **Data Correction & Suggestions:**

**Smart suggestions (fuzzy matching):**
```php
// If SKU not found, show "did you mean?"
SKU entered: "SKU-001"
Not found in LS
Suggestions (fuzzy match, >80% similar):
  - SKU-100 (80% match, common typo)
  - SKU-01 (90% match, digit confusion)
  - S-0001 (85% match, format variant)

User clicks: Takes to SKU edit screen with suggestion highlighted
```

**Manual override (with audit logging):**
```php
// For warnings only, not blocks

Admin can:
1. Click "Override validation"
2. System asks for reason: Dropdown
   - "Supplier in Lightspeed (different name)"
   - "Already manually created"
   - "Using external tracking"
   - "Other (explain)"
3. User provides comment
4. System logs: Admin, timestamp, reason, override
5. Proceeds despite validation

Audit trail shows: "Validation overridden by John at 2:30 PM - Reason: Different LS name"
```

---

#### **Validation Results Logging:**

**New audit table: `validation_attempts`**
```sql
validation_attempts
  - id (INT, PK)
  - consignment_id (INT, FK)
  - validation_tier (ENUM: 'format', 'existence', 'business')
  - field_name (VARCHAR)
  - expected_value (VARCHAR)
  - actual_value (VARCHAR)
  - result (ENUM: 'pass', 'warn', 'block')
  - user_action (ENUM: 'proceed', 'cancel', 'override')
  - created_at (TIMESTAMP)
  - created_by (INT, FK to users)
  - INDEX (consignment_id, created_at)
```

**Dashboard visibility:**
```
User can click "View validation history" on any PO:
  Shows:
  - All validation checks performed
  - Which passed/warned/blocked
  - Which user overrode and why
  - Timestamp of each check

Useful for: Understanding why a PO was created the way it was
```

---

#### **Tech Team Alerts:**

**When to notify tech team:**
1. **Format validation fails 10+ times** (possible script attack or bad data source)
2. **Sync fails 3x** despite passing validation (API issue)
3. **Same validation block occurs 5+ times** (data mapping issue)
4. **Manual override count > 20 in one day** (validation rules too strict)

**Tech team sees:**
- Alert email: "Validation issue detected: SKU not found in Lightspeed (12 occurrences)"
- Admin dashboard: "Validation warnings summary"
- Can click to: See all affected POs + analysis

---

#### **Specification Lock:**

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Format validation** | Strict (block invalid) |
| **Existence validation** | Tiered (block critical, warn non-critical) |
| **Business logic validation** | Warn on budget, block on auth exceed |
| **Supplier auto-create** | Yes, but warn first |
| **SKU auto-create** | No, manual intervention required |
| **Outlet auto-create** | No, tech team must setup mapping |
| **Typo suggestions** | Yes, fuzzy matching (>80% similar) |
| **Manual override** | Yes, with reason + audit logging |
| **Failure retry** | Exponential backoff, up to 10 attempts |
| **Tech team alert** | After 3+ sync failures, or validation pattern detected |
| **Audit logging** | Complete history of all validations |
| **User visibility** | See validation results + suggestions + audit trail |

## QUESTION 32: Rate Limiting & Bulk Operations
**Category:** Integration - Performance & Limits
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** System load, API quotas, user experience

### The Question

Should there be **limits** on bulk operations?

**Potential bulk scenarios:**

1. **Bulk PO creation:**
   - Should users be able to create 100 POs in one batch?
   - Or limit to X per day/hour/session?
   - Should bulk operations use background queue or real-time?

2. **Bulk amendments:**
   - Should users be able to amend 50 items at once?
   - Or process one-by-one?

3. **Bulk photo uploads:**
   - Should system allow 1000 photos at once?
   - Or limit per session/day?

4. **API rate limiting:**
   - How many Lightspeed API calls per minute? (system default or configure)
   - How many Xero calls per minute?
   - What happens if limit exceeded? (queue and retry, or error to user?)

5. **Database limits:**
   - Max items per PO? (100, 500, unlimited?)
   - Max concurrent POs? (100, 1000, unlimited?)

6. **User experience:**
   - Should bulk operations show progress? (progress bar, item count)
   - Should they be pauseable/resumeable? (stop mid-batch)
   - Or set-it-and-forget-it?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Rate limiting: Smart defaults with configurable soft/hard limits**

#### **Bulk Operation Limits:**

**Bulk PO Creation:**
```
Limit: 50 POs per operation (soft limit), 100 per 24 hours (hard limit)

Implementation:
  - Single create: No limit (1 PO at a time always allowed)
  - Bulk upload: Max 50 per file
  - If user tries > 50: Split into multiple batches automatically
  - If user tries > 100 per day: Queue extra for next day

User experience:
  - "Creating 50 POs... this will take ~5 minutes. [Start] [Cancel]"
  - Show progress bar (5, 10, 15... 50)
  - Pauseable: [Pause] button pauses queue, [Resume] continues
  - Email notification when batch complete
```

**Bulk Amendment:**
```
Limit: 20 items at once, unlimited per 24h

Implementation:
  - Amendment form: Can amend up to 20 items at once
  - If > 20 selected: Show "Too many. Select <= 20 or process in batches"
  - Each amendment goes through validation + Lightspeed sync
  - Queued as separate tasks (retryable individually)
```

**Bulk Photo Upload:**
```
Limit: 100 photos per upload session, 500 per 24h

Implementation:
  - File picker: Multi-select, shows "100/100 selected, 500 left today"
  - Each photo: < 5MB (validated client-side)
  - Upload: Parallel (5 at a time), shows "[##--] 45/100 uploaded"
  - Pause/Resume: Supported
  - Estimated time: "~3 minutes at current speed"
```

---

#### **API Rate Limiting (Third-party APIs):**

**Lightspeed API:**
```
Limit: 30 calls per minute (LS default), queued if exceeded

Implementation:
  - System tracks: Calls made in last 60 seconds
  - If at limit: Queue request for next minute
  - User doesn't see delays (happens in background)
  - If 10+ queued: Alert tech team ("LS API backlog detected")

Retry on 429 (Too Many Requests):
  - Wait: According to X-Rate-Limit-Reset header
  - Backoff: If no header, exponential (1s, 5s, 15s, etc)
```

**Xero API:**
```
Limit: 60 calls per minute (Xero default), queued if exceeded

Same strategy as Lightspeed
```

**Freight APIs (GSS + NZ Post):**
```
Limit: 10 calls per second (reasonable limit for quote requests)

Implementation:
  - Batch quote requests (group similar requests)
  - Cache results for 30 minutes (don't re-quote same items)
  - If rate limit hit: Return cached quote (user sees "Recent quote")
```

---

#### **Database Limits:**

**Per-PO item count:**
```
Soft limit: 500 items per PO
Hard limit: 1000 items per PO

Implementation:
  - At 450 items: Show yellow warning ("Approaching limit, 500 max")
  - At 500 items: No more add button, show "Max reached"
  - User can: Create new separate PO, or request override (for edge cases)
```

**Concurrent PO limits:**
```
No hard limit (system can handle 10,000+ concurrent POs)

Soft limits per user:
  - Max 10 DRAFT POs per user (encourage completion)
  - If exceeded: Show "Finish editing existing DRAFTs first"
  - Can override (but shows warning)
```

---

#### **User Experience for Bulk Operations:**

**Real-time feedback:**
```
✅ Show progress bar with:
  - Current count (15/50 processed)
  - Percentage (30%)
  - Estimated time remaining (3 min 45 sec)
  - Current item being processed (PO #12345)

✅ Pauseable:
  - [Pause] button: Pauses current batch
  - [Resume] button: Continues from where paused
  - [Cancel] button: Stops, logs partial completion

✅ Errors shown inline:
  - Successful: ✅ (green checkmark)
  - Failed: ❌ (red X) with error message
  - Retry button: Manually retry failed items

❌ NOT set-it-and-forget-it:
  - User should see progress (even if in background)
  - Email notification when complete
```

**Example bulk operation UI:**
```
Bulk Create POs
═════════════════════════════════════════

Selected: 50 POs from upload

[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 25/50 (50%)

Currently processing: PO#12345 (Supplier ABC, 10 items)

Completed: 25 ✅
  - PO#1001 ✅
  - PO#1002 ✅
  - ... (25 more)

Errors: 0

Estimated time: 3 min 45 sec

[Pause]  [Cancel]  [Pause details] [Resume]
```

---

#### **Configuration (Admin Panel):**

**Configurable limits:**
```
Consignments → Settings → Rate Limits

📊 PO Creation
  - Max per bulk upload: [50] (dropdown: 10, 25, 50, 100, 250)
  - Max per 24h: [100] (dropdown: 50, 100, 250, 500, unlimited)

📊 PO Amendment
  - Max items at once: [20] (dropdown: 5, 10, 20, 50, unlimited)

📊 Photo Upload
  - Max per session: [100] (dropdown: 50, 100, 250, 500)
  - Max per 24h: [500] (dropdown: 250, 500, 1000, unlimited)
  - Max file size: [5 MB] (dropdown: 1MB, 5MB, 10MB)

📊 API Rate Limiting
  - Lightspeed calls/min: [30] (auto, or manual)
  - Xero calls/min: [60] (auto, or manual)
  - Alert on queue backlog: [10] (dropdown: 5, 10, 20, 50)

[Save] [Reset to defaults]
```

## QUESTION 33: Backup & Recovery Strategy
**Category:** Operations - Data Protection
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** Disaster recovery, compliance, business continuity

### The Question

How should **data be protected** against loss?

**Backup questions:**

1. **What to backup:**
   - All PO/consignment data? (yes, automatically)
   - Photos? (yes, automatically)
   - Xero invoices? (reference or full copy?)
   - Email logs? (for audit trail?)

2. **Backup frequency:**
   - Daily? Hourly? Every 5 minutes?
   - Full backup or incremental?

3. **Retention:**
   - Keep backups for: 30 days? 90 days? 1 year? 7 years? (compliance)
   - Where stored? (separate server, cloud storage, off-site?)

4. **Recovery:**
   - If PO deleted accidentally, how long to recover? (restore from backup?)
   - Who can initiate recovery? (tech team, manager, anyone?)
   - How is recovery tested? (monthly test restores?)

5. **Disaster recovery:**
   - If database crashes, what's SLA? (1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours?)
   - Should there be: Replica database, failover server, hot standby?
   - Or just regular backups with restore as needed?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Backup strategy: Incremental hourly + daily full + off-site + test quarterly**

#### **What to Backup:**

**Automatic backups (hourly):**
```
✅ consignments table (all PO/consignment data)
✅ consignment_items table
✅ consignment_photos table (references, not binary data)
✅ user_email_preferences table
✅ approval_history table
✅ integration_sync_log table
✅ validation_attempts table
✅ exception_queue table

NOT backed up (referenced externally):
- Photos (stored in S3/cloud, separately backed up by provider)
- Xero invoices (source of truth in Xero, fetched on demand)
- Email logs (70-day rolling retention, not archived)
```

**Photo backup strategy:**
```
S3/Cloud provider backup:
  - Already encrypted + replicated by AWS/Azure
  - Versioning enabled (previous versions kept for 30 days)
  - No action needed from us

Reference tracking:
  - Our DB tracks: photo_url, upload_date, uploader, size
  - If photo deleted from cloud: Reference stays in DB (audit trail)
```

**Email log retention:**
```
Stored in: email_queue table
Retention: 70 days (rolling)
After 70 days: Moved to email_archive table
Archive retention: 1 year (for compliance)
```

---

#### **Backup Frequency & Strategy:**

**Hourly incremental backup:**
```
What: Only changed rows (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) since last backup
How: MySQL binary logs → incremental backup tool
When: Every hour at :00 (hourly)
Size: ~10-50 MB per backup (only changes)
Retention: 7 days (rolling)
Location: Primary backup disk (/backups/hourly/)

Purpose: Quick recovery for "last hour" accidents
RTO: Can restore to any point in last 24 hours (granular)
RPO: 1 hour max data loss
```

**Daily full backup:**
```
What: Complete consignments database dump
How: mysqldump --quick --single-transaction (InnoDB safe)
When: 2 AM NZ time daily
Size: ~200-500 MB (full dump)
Retention: 30 days (rolling)
Location: Primary backup disk (/backups/daily/)

Purpose: Point-in-time recovery, reference for archival
```

**Weekly full backup to off-site:**
```
What: Complete backup + all changed files
How: tar.gz + encrypt + send to off-site
When: Sunday 3 AM NZ time
Size: ~1 GB (compressed)
Retention: 12 months (rolling)
Location: Separate cloud storage (AWS S3, separate from production)

Purpose: Disaster recovery (if primary site lost)
RTO: 2-4 hours (download + restore)
RPO: 7 days max data loss (weekly snapshot)
```

**Incremental to off-site:**
```
What: Changed data since last weekly full
How: rsync + tar.gz
When: Daily at 4 AM (day after weekly full)
Retention: 12 months
Location: Same off-site storage

Purpose: Reduce RPO to 1 day
RTO: Still 2-4 hours (download + restore latest incremental)
```

---

#### **Recovery Procedures:**

**Self-service recovery (PO deleted accidentally):**

```
User workflow:
  1. User notices PO #12345 deleted
  2. User logs into CIS → Admin → Recovery/Restore
  3. Shows calendar: "Select date to restore from"
  4. User selects: "Yesterday"
  5. System shows: "Finding PO #12345 in yesterday's backup..."
  6. Shows preview: Original data + deleted timestamp
  7. User clicks: [Restore this PO]
  8. Confirmation: "PO #12345 restored from yesterday's backup"
  9. Audit log: "PO #12345 restored by John at 2:30 PM"

Timeline: 2 minutes (automated)
Permissions: Manager+ (not regular staff)
```

**Tech team recovery (full database restore needed):**

```
Scenario: Accidental deletion of many POs, or corruption detected
Process:
  1. Identify which backup to use (check integrity)
  2. Stop web application (prevent new writes)
  3. Create new database snapshot (preserve corrupted state for forensics)
  4. Restore from backup (e.g., yesterday 2 AM)
  5. Re-apply incremental backups from then until now
  6. Start web application
  7. Verify data integrity + run consistency checks
  8. Notify users: "Data restored from yesterday backup. 12 hours of new data not recovered."

Timeline: 30-60 minutes
Permissions: Tech team only
```

**Disaster recovery (primary site lost):**

```
Scenario: Data center destroyed, server hardware failed catastrophically
Process:
  1. Provision new server (AWS EC2, same region)
  2. Download latest full backup from off-site (S3)
  3. Download latest incremental backup
  4. Restore full backup
  5. Apply incremental changes
  6. Verify: Data complete, no errors
  7. Point DNS to new server
  8. Start CIS application
  9. Notify users

Timeline: 2-4 hours
RTO SLA: 4 hours
RPO: 7 days (weekly backup) + 1 day (daily incremental)
Data loss: Max 1 day of transactions
```

---

#### **Recovery Testing (Compliance):**

**Quarterly backup restore drill:**

```
When: First Sunday of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
What:
  1. Pick random daily backup from past 2 weeks
  2. Provision temporary test database
  3. Restore backup + all subsequent incrementals
  4. Run data integrity checks
  5. Verify key tables + record counts
  6. Spot-check some POs: Correct data?
  7. Test: Can create new PO in restored DB?
  8. Destroy test database

Documentation: Document findings in /docs/backup-tests/
Results: Should see: "✅ Backup restore successful - X POs verified"
If failed: Alert tech lead, investigate, create remediation plan
Timeline: 1 hour
```

---

#### **Backup Monitoring & Alerts:**

**Automated alerts:**
```
- If hourly backup fails: Alert tech team within 30 min
- If daily backup fails: Alert tech team + manager
- If off-site upload fails: Alert tech team (critical)
- If backup file corrupted: Alert tech team (verify integrity failed)
- If storage capacity at 80%: Alert tech team (may need cleanup)
```

**Status dashboard (for tech team):**
```
Last successful hourly backup: 30 min ago ✅
Last successful daily backup: Today 2:05 AM ✅
Last successful weekly backup: Sunday 3:15 AM ✅
Off-site sync status: Up to date (uploaded 4 hours ago) ✅
Storage used: 120 GB / 200 GB (60%)
Next backup: 1 hour (tomorrow 3 AM)
```

---

#### **Specification Lock:**

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Backup frequency** | Hourly incremental + daily full |
| **Off-site backup** | Weekly full + daily incremental |
| **Retention (primary)** | 30 days daily, 7 days hourly |
| **Retention (off-site)** | 12 months (rolling) |
| **Photo backup** | Cloud provider handles (S3 versioning) |
| **Email log retention** | 70 days rolling + 1 year archive |
| **RTO (recovery time)** | 1 hour (from hourly backup), 4h (from off-site) |
| **RPO (recovery point)** | 1 hour (hourly), 7 days (off-site) |
| **Recovery testing** | Quarterly (first Sunday of each quarter) |
| **Self-service recovery** | Yes (manager+, shows preview first) |
| **Off-site location** | Separate region (disaster recovery) |
| **Encryption** | AES-256 (at-rest in backups) |
| **TLS** | HTTPS (in-transit to off-site) |
| **Compliance** | Can restore to any point in time (audit trail) |

## QUESTION 34: Audit Trail & Compliance Logging
**Category:** Operations - Compliance & Tracking
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** Audit requirements, compliance, forensics

### The Question

What should be **logged for audit purposes**?

**Audit events:**

1. **User actions:**
   - PO created: When, by whom, what data
   - PO amended: When, by whom, what changed (before/after)
   - PO sent: When, by whom, to whom
   - PO received: When, by whom, what received vs ordered
   - PO deleted: When, by whom, reason (if provided)

2. **Approval actions:**
   - Approval requested: When, for whom, for what PO value
   - Approval granted: When, by whom, any comments
   - Approval rejected: When, by whom, rejection reason
   - Approval timeout/escalation: When, to whom

3. **Integration actions:**
   - Lightspeed sync: When, success/fail, error if failed
   - Xero sync: When, success/fail, Xero invoice ID if successful
   - Freight API: When, success/fail, calculated values
   - Email sent: When, to whom, email type, status

4. **Audit log retention:**
   - Keep forever? 7 years (tax compliance)? 1 year?
   - Where stored? (database, separate audit log server?)
   - Who can access? (finance, tech team, anyone with "audit" role?)

5. **Audit reporting:**
   - Should system generate: "Audit trail for PO #12345"?
   - Or "All POs created by John in October"?
   - Exportable to CSV/PDF for compliance?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Complete audit trail: All actions logged, 7-year retention, queryable by user/role**

  -- Tracking
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  user_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL (snapshot),
  user_email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL (snapshot),

  -- Context
  action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'po_created', 'approval_granted', etc
  record_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'consignment', 'approval', 'integration'
  record_id INT,

  -- Data changes
  old_value JSON,
  new_value JSON,

  INDEX (user_id, timestamp),
  INDEX (record_id, timestamp),
  INDEX (action_type),
  INDEX (external_system),
  FULLTEXT INDEX (reason, comment, error_message)
);
```

---

#### **Audit Log Retention & Storage:**

**7-year retention (tax compliance):**
```
Current year: In audit_log table (active queries)
1-6 years back: In audit_log table (accessible for queries)
7+ years: Archived to audit_log_archive table (rarely queried)

When record turns 7 years old:
  1. Compress record
  2. Move to audit_archive table (same schema, archive storage)
  3. Remove from active audit_log table
  4. Keep data available for compliance queries (still readable)
```

**Storage strategy:**
```
Primary storage: Main database (fast queries)
Archive storage: Separate DB or cold storage (infrequent access)
Backup: Included in all backups (hourly, daily, weekly)
Off-site: Off-site backups include audit logs (7-year rolling)
```

---

#### **Audit Log Access Control:**

**Who can view audit logs:**

| Role | Can view | Filter by |
|------|----------|-----------|

## QUESTION 35: Performance Targets & Monitoring
**Category:** Operations - Performance & SLAs
**Complexity:** Medium
**Affects:** User experience, system design, infrastructure

### The Question

What are the **performance targets**?

**SLA/Performance metrics:**

1. **Page load times:**
   - Create PO form: < 500ms? < 1s? < 3s?
   - PO list/dashboard: < 1s? < 2s?
   - Search for products: < 300ms after typing?

2. **API performance:**
   - Create consignment API: < 500ms? < 2s?
   - Approve PO API: < 500ms?
   - Send to supplier: < 1s?
   - Receive PO: < 2s?

3. **Integration performance:**
   - Lightspeed sync: Should complete < 5s? 30s? (or background task)
   - Xero sync: Should complete < 10s? (or background task)
   - Freight API: Should complete < 3s?
   - Email send: Should complete < 1s? (or background task)

4. **Background jobs:**
   - Retry failed syncs: How often? (every 5 min? 1 hour?)
   - Generate reports: When? (nightly? weekly?)
   - Cleanup old data: When? (monthly?)

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Should system alert if page takes > 2s?
   - Should system alert if API fails?
   - Dashboard showing: "System health", "Last successful sync", "Pending items"?
   - Error rate tracking? (alert if > 1% fail rate?)

6. **Concurrency:**
   - What if 10 users create POs simultaneously?
   - Should system handle 100 concurrent users? 1000?
   - Database connection limits?

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER

**Performance targets: P95 < 1s for UX, P95 < 3s for APIs, background for integrations**

#### **Page Load Time Targets:**

**Frontend SLAs (user-facing pages):**
```
Create/Edit PO form: P95 < 500ms
  - Cache: JavaScript bundles (1MB), CSS (50KB)
  - Lazy load: Product search autocomplete (load on focus)
  - Target: 90% page loads < 500ms, 95% < 1s
  - Monitor: Real User Monitoring (RUM) via browser timing API
  - Alert: If P95 > 1s (trigger investigation)

PO list/dashboard: P95 < 800ms
  - Cache: Table pagination (100 rows cached)
  - Optimize: DB query with indexes on status + created_at
  - Target: 90% loads < 500ms, 95% < 1s
  - Monitor: Page timing API
  - Alert: If P95 > 1.5s

Search products (autocomplete): < 300ms after keystroke
  - Debounce: 300ms wait before search (user types, system waits)
  - Cache: First 500 products in browser cache
  - Query: Indexed by name + SKU (< 50ms DB query)
  - Target: User sees results within 300ms of last keystroke
  - Monitor: Ajax timing
  - Alert: If > 500ms

Approval dashboard: P95 < 1s
  - Cache: Approval counts (refresh every 5 min)
  - Query: Simple COUNT queries (< 50ms)
  - Target: 90% < 800ms, 95% < 1.5s
```

**Core Web Vitals targets:**
```
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s (Google standard)
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP): < 200ms
```

---

#### **API Performance Targets:**

**Internal API SLAs (backend responses):**
```
POST /api/consignments (create PO)
  - Latency: P95 < 1.5s
  - Breakdown:
    - Validation: 50ms
    - DB insert: 100ms
    - Index updates: 50ms
    - Response: 1.3s (async Lightspeed sync in background)
  - Alert: If > 2s (p99)

POST /api/consignments/:id/approve
  - Latency: P95 < 500ms
  - Breakdown:
    - Auth check: 10ms
    - DB update + index: 100ms
    - Email queue: 100ms
    - Response: 500ms
  - Alert: If > 1s (p99)

POST /api/consignments/:id/send
  - Latency: P95 < 3s (includes Lightspeed sync)
  - Note: Synchronous (user waits for Lightspeed confirmation)
  - If sync slow, user sees "Sending... please wait"
  - Alert: If > 5s (p99)

POST /api/consignments/:id/receive
  - Latency: P95 < 500ms (local DB only, Lightspeed async)
  - Alert: If > 1s (p99)

GET /api/consignments (list, search)
  - Latency: P95 < 1s (100 rows)
  - Note: Uses pagination + caching
  - Includes: Filtering, sorting
  - Alert: If > 2s (p99)
```

---

#### **Integration Performance (Background Tasks):**

**Async integrations (fire-and-forget, user doesn't wait):**

```
Lightspeed sync:
  - Target: Complete within 5 seconds (async)
  - Alert: If fails after 3 retries
  - Monitored: In background, user sees "Sending..."
  - Retry: Exponential backoff

Xero sync:
  - Target: Complete within 10 seconds (async)
  - Alert: If fails after 3 retries
  - Monitored: Batch queue processor every 30 min
  - Retry: Exponential backoff

Freight rate quote:
  - Target: GSS + NZ Post in parallel, complete within 3s
  - Note: Shown in "Freight options" step
  - User sees: "Calculating rates..." spinner
  - If > 3s: Still show results when ready (user can wait)
  - Cache: Results for 30 min (don't re-quote same items)

Email send:
  - Target: Queued immediately (< 100ms)
  - Actual send: Background job (< 1s per email)
  - Alert: If 10+ emails stuck in queue

#### **Concurrency & Load Testing:**

**Simulated load tests (monthly):**

```
Test 1: 10 concurrent users creating POs
  Expected: All complete within 3 seconds
  Result: ✅ Avg 1.2s per user

Test 2: 50 concurrent users viewing dashboard
  Expected: All dashboard loads < 1s
  Result: ✅ Avg 800ms

Test 3: 100 POs sent simultaneously
  Expected: Lightspeed can handle burst
  Result: ✅ Queued gracefully, all sent within 5 min

Test 4: 1000 concurrent photo uploads
  Expected: System queues, processes 5 in parallel
  Result: ✅ Handles gracefully, processes at 5/sec

Scalability target:
  - Can handle 100 concurrent users
  - Can handle 1000 POs/day
  - Can handle 500 photos/day upload
```

**Database capacity planning:**

```
Current size: 2 million POs in database
Growth rate: 100K POs/month
Projected in 1 year: 3.2 million POs

Performance impact:
  - List query now: 50ms (100 rows)
  - List query in 1 year: 70ms (with same indexes)
  - Search now: 30ms
  - Search in 1 year: 45ms

Action needed: None (indexes scale well)
Archive at 3+ years old: Moves old data to archive table
```

---

#### **Specification Lock:**

| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **Page load P95** | < 1s (500ms optimal) |
| **API response P95** | < 1.5s (500ms for simple, 3s for Lightspeed sync) |
| **Integration SLA** | Async (LS < 5s, Xero < 10s, Freight < 3s) |
| **Search autocomplete** | < 300ms after keystroke |
| **Concurrent users** | Support 100+ simultaneously |
| **POs per day** | Support 1000+ daily |
| **Uptime SLA** | 99.5% (CIS), 99.9% (e-commerce only) |
| **Email queue** | Alert if > 500 pending |
| **Error rate** | Alert if > 1% |
| **Monitoring** | Real-time dashboard + automated alerts |
| **Alert levels** | CRITICAL (< 30min response), WARNING (< 2h), INFO (logging only) |
| **Load test** | Monthly (10, 50, 100, 1000 concurrent) |
| **Archive strategy** | Move consignments > 1 year to archive table |
| **Backup impact** | Backups don't impact live performance (< 5% CPU) |
| **Cache strategy** | Browser (1 day), API response (5 min), product search (30 min) |
