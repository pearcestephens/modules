## üìã STRUCTURED QUESTION SET

### SECTION 1: PRODUCT SEARCH & SELECTION (Q16-Q18)

#### Q16: How does product search/selection work in Pack mode?
**Context:** When packing a transfer, how do staff add products?

**Options to clarify:**
- [ ] Barcode scanning only?
- [ ] Manual SKU entry?
- [ ] Product name search (with autocomplete)?
- [ ] Product browse/filter by category?
- [ ] Recently packed products shortcut?
- [ ] Favorites/common products list?

**Your Answer:**
```
[AWAITING INPUT FROM PEARCE]

Nope bar code scanning is an optional tool but it is a tool that still needs to be done in very high quality. different sounds. lots features.
yes manuel sku entry is fine when searching for a product that you have recieved unintentional
yes of course auto complete.
yes all the filters
not sure about a shortcut
not sure about that fav/commons Either
allow power uses to select multiple products, and to add them to other transfers that are also same draft/packed status and are at same outlet.
make the barcode thing if selected full featured and be a high end barcoding system


```

**Follow-up questions:**
- What happens if they scan an unknown barcode?
- Can they add products not in the original PO?
- Is there a "quick add" feature for common items?


they will go look for the product, add it by words. if none of above they need to select in the purchase order list that they have received a product they didnt order. we check if its been paid. they take pictures of it and supply a name if possible. once management has it we make a decision

yes they can only on receivving end.
yes there is meant to be Add Product for all sending/ recieving transfers and purchase order receving for unexpected products

---

#### Q17: What validation happens when adding products to Pack mode?
**Context:** What checks are performed when staff scan/add a product?

**Validations to confirm:**
- [ ] Product exists in system?
- [ ] Product is in the approved PO?
- [ ] Quantity doesn't exceed requested amount?
- [ ] Product hasn't been discontinued?
- [ ] Barcode matches SKU?
- [ ] Warehouse location check?

**Your Answer:**
```
[AWAITING INPUT FROM PEARCE]

is ok if doesnt have stock
optionally approved
doesnt have to exceed no - flagged if not match
- we dont have data for this currently re discontinued
no barcode matching
no warehouse checks


```

---

#### Q18: Can staff pack quantities different from requested?
**Context:** What if supplier sends 10 instead of 12 requested?

**Scenarios to clarify:**
- [ ] Pack less than requested (short supply)?
- [ ] Pack more than requested (bonus/overpack)?
- [ ] Pack zero (item unavailable)?
- [ ] Split pack (pack 5 now, 7 later)?

**Your Answer:**
```
IMMMEDIATELY GETS FLAGGED, WE TAKE PHOTO OF THE PAPER PACKING SLIP AND PHTOSO OF STOCK SHOOWING SHORTFALL
GETS APPROVED BY MANAGEMENT AND GOES TO SUPPLIERS FOR A WARRANTY / REIMBURSEMENT claim
PACKS WE GET MORE OF WE NOTE DOWN AND CHECK IT ISISNT A SUBSTITUTE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SAY NOHING IF Frequency
CHECK AGAINST INVOICE AND DO NOTHING IF BOTH 0
SPLIT PACK IS TECHNICALLY OK. WONT KNOW UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSFER. WILL BE CLAIMED AND MANAGEMENT NOTIFIED.




```

**Follow-up questions:**
- Are there approval requirements for quantity changes?
- How are short-packs handled in Lightspeed?
- What about over-delivery (bonus stock)?

CANT CHANGE IT ANYWAY, U GET GIVE NUMBERS, U JUST CHANGE WHAT YOU SEND / RECIEVE

WE KEEP BONUS STOCK. DONT MAKE A FUSS JUST CONTINUE ON

### SECTION 2: PURCHASE ORDER MANAGEMENT (Q19-Q21)

#### Q19: Can staff amend PO after approval but before packing?

- [ ] Change pricing?
- [ ] Change delivery date?
- [ ] Change supplier?

**Your Answer:**
```
DEFAULT IS TO SAY
NO REMOVE - WE JUST TRY UPDATE IT OR THEY CAN UPDATE IT VIA SUPPLIER PORTAL SO THAT PRODUCT SAYS 0, STAFF SUBMIT AS 0
STAFF WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF CHANGING PRICING BUT WE WILL KEEP IT SIMPLE AND OFF FOR NOW BY DEFAULT. THOUGH IF THEY DO HAVE A INVOICE, THEY ENTER THE PRICES
IF ITS DIFFERENT FROM OUR KNOWN PRICE, IT GETS FLAGGED.
DELIVERY DATE IS INOT IMPORTANT / IF WE CHANGE SUPPLIER WE WIOULD JUST SEND UP CANCELIING THE ORDER AND CREATING A NEW ONE.

## üí° TIPS FOR EFFICIENT DATA CAPTURE

### Be Specific
‚ùå "Staff do the normal thing"
‚úÖ "Staff scan barcode, system validates against PO, then prompts for quantity confirmation"

### Include Edge Cases
‚ùå "Products are added to pack"
‚úÖ "Products are scanned. If duplicate scan, increment quantity. If not in PO, prompt: 'Add anyway?' with Manager Override required."

### Reference Examples
‚ùå "Like the other system"
‚úÖ "Similar to how Xero handles approvals: Email notification ‚Üí Approve/Reject buttons ‚Üí Auto-update status"

### Think Process, Not Technology
Focus on **WHAT** happens and **WHY**, not **HOW** technically.
Agent will figure out implementation details.
