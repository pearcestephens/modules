## 🔌 Integration Architecture

### High Level
```
pack-pro.php (UI)
    ↓ AJAX
pack-freight.js (JavaScript)
    ↓ $.post()
TransferController (PHP)
    ↓ function calls
FreightIntegrationBridge (NEW - wrapper class)
    ↓ file_get_contents()
api.php (existing freight system)
    ↓ includes/requires
Freight* classes (existing system)
    ↓ database queries
vend_products, transfers, etc (existing tables)
```

### Implementation Steps
1. **Create Bridge** → Wrapper around `/assets/services/core/freight/api.php`
2. **Add Endpoints** → Controller methods that call bridge
3. **Add JavaScript** → AJAX calls to controller endpoints
4. **Add HTML** → UI components in pack-pro.php
5. **Test** → Verify all workflows work

## 📊 What Each Component Does

### FreightIntegrationBridge.php (250 lines)
**Purpose:** Wrapper around freight API, used by controllers
**Key Methods:**
- `getTransferMetrics()` - Get weight, volume, containers, rates
- `createLabel()` - Create shipping label, get tracking
- `getTracking()` - Get shipment status
- `previewLabel()` - Preview before printing

**Why:** Makes API calls easy, handles errors, manages cache

---

### TransferController Endpoints (4 methods)
**Purpose:** HTTP endpoints called by JavaScript
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /transfers/{id}/freight-metrics` - Returns JSON metrics
- `POST /transfers/{id}/create-label` - Creates label, returns tracking
- `GET /transfers/{id}/label-preview` - Returns preview URL
- `GET /shipments/{trackingNumber}/tracking` - Returns tracking status

**Why:** Separates HTTP concerns from business logic

---

### pack-freight.js (300 lines)
**Purpose:** JavaScript class for UI interaction
**Key Methods:**
- `loadMetrics()` - AJAX call to get metrics
- `displayMetrics()` - Update UI with metrics
- `showCarrierRates()` - Display rate options
- `selectCarrier()` - Select carrier/service
- `createLabel()` - Call API to create label
- `trackShipment()` - Poll tracking status
- `displayTracking()` - Show tracking in UI

**Why:** Handles all client-side logic, AJAX calls, UI updates

---

### pack-pro.php (freight section)
**Purpose:** UI components for freight console
**Components:**
- Metrics display (weight, volume, containers, cost)
- Button group (load metrics, show rates, create label)
- Carrier rates grid (clickable rate options)
- Label display (tracking number, download link)
- Tracking display (status, events, ETA)

**Why:** Provides user interface for freight operations

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: API Health Check
```bash
curl "https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/assets/services/core/freight/api.php?action=health"
```
Expected: JSON with `"success": true`

---

### Test 2: Weight Calculation
```bash
curl "https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/assets/services/core/freight/api.php?action=calculate_weight&items=%5B%7B%22product_id%22%3A%22SKU-001%22%2C%22quantity%22%3A2%7D%5D"
```
Expected: JSON with `total_weight_kg` > 0

---

### Test 3: Bridge Class
```php
$bridge = new \CIS\Modules\Consignments\Lib\FreightIntegrationBridge($pdo);
$metrics = $bridge->getTransferMetrics(12345);
var_dump($metrics);
```
Expected: Array with weight_kg, volume_m3, containers, rates

---

### Test 4: Full Workflow
```php
// Load metrics
$metrics = $bridge->getTransferMetrics(12345);

// Get recommended carrier
$carrier = $metrics['recommended']['carrier'];  // 'nzpost'
$service = $metrics['recommended']['service'];  // 'standard'

// Create label
$label = $bridge->createLabel(12345, $carrier, $service);

// Track shipment
$tracking = $bridge->getTracking($label['tracking_number']);
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "API_UNAVAILABLE"
**Cause:** `/assets/services/core/freight/api.php` not found or not readable
**Solution:** Check file exists, check permissions, verify path

---

### Issue: Weight shows 0kg
**Cause:** Products missing weight_grams column or transfer_items empty
**Solution:** Add weight to vend_products, populate transfer_items

---

### Issue: Label creation times out
**Cause:** Normal - external API call can take 1-3 seconds
**Solution:** Increase PHP timeout: `set_time_limit(10);`

---

### Issue: JavaScript not loading
**Cause:** Script path incorrect or not linked
**Solution:** Verify `<script src="...">` path in pack-pro.php
