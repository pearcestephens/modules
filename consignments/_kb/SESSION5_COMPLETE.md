## What You're Getting

### Email Templates (Q27)
- Professional responsive HTML design
- Black header + yellow brand accent
- Two variants: Internal + Supplier
- Fully configurable (logo, contact, address, email)
- Production-ready code reference from purchase-orders.php

### Delivery Strategy (Q28)
- Hybrid real-time + digest + daily approach
- Queue-based with 3-tier priority system
- 30-minute batching interval
- User preference configuration
- 3 cron jobs (1min, 30min, 8AM)

### Exception Handling (Q29)
- Tiered routing (tech team, finance, approvers)
- Auto-escalation with manual override
- Exception dashboard for management
- Day 7→Manager, Day 10→Director escalation

### Integration Sequencing (Q30)
- Optimistic commit strategy (user-facing status commits immediately)
- Lightspeed = blocking, others = async retry
- Eventual consistency (all sync within 24h)
- Exponential backoff retry logic

### Data Validation (Q31)
- 3-tier validation (format, existence, business logic)
- Smart fuzzy matching for typos
- Manual override with audit logging
- Validation audit trail for compliance

### Rate Limiting (Q32)
- 50 PO/batch, 100 per 24h
- API queue when limits hit (Lightspeed 30/min, Xero 60/min)
- Progress tracking with pause/resume
- Configurable via admin panel

### Backup Strategy (Q33)
- Hourly incremental (7-day retention)
- Daily full backups (30-day retention)
- Weekly off-site backups (12-month retention)
- Self-service recovery (preview first, then confirm)
- 1-hour RTO, 4-hour RTO off-site

### Audit Trail (Q34)
- Complete logging of ALL actions
- 7-year retention (tax compliance)
- Role-based access control
- 5+ built-in compliance reports
- Immutable audit table (integrity enforced)

### Performance Targets (Q35)
- Pages: P95 < 1s (500ms optimal)
- APIs: P95 < 1.5s (3s for Lightspeed sync)
- Integrations: Async (< 5s Lightspeed, < 10s Xero)
- 99.5% uptime SLA
- Monthly load tests (10, 50, 100, 1000 concurrent)
