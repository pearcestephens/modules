## 📊 Key Insights from Session 1

### DRAFT Status System (Game Changer!)
**Original assumption:** POs created as ACTIVE
**Reality:** POs should be DRAFT until confirmed
**Impact:** Changes entire workflow architecture

**Workflow:**
1. Create PO → DRAFT status
2. Review & confirm → ACTIVE status
3. Receive items → RECEIVED
4. Close → COMPLETED

### Multi-Tier Approval
**By Threshold:**
- $0-$2k: Store Manager approves
- $2k-$5k: Retail Ops or Comms Manager
- $5k+: Director approves

**Not by single person** - enables scalability

### Lightspeed Integration
**Sync happens:** At receive time (not at PO creation)
**Why:** Real data at that point
**Impact:** Simplifies initial creation, complex at receive
