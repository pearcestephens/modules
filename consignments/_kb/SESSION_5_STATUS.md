## üìä PROGRESS SNAPSHOT

```
Total Questions: 35
Answered: 20 ‚úÖ
  - Q1-Q15: Sessions 1-2 ‚úÖ
  - Q16-Q20: Session 5 ‚úÖ
Remaining: 15 (Q21-Q35)
  - Q21-Q25: Multi-tier approval
  - Q26-Q30: Email notifications
  - Q31-Q35: Integration & edge cases

Percentage Complete: 57% (20/35)
```

---

## üöÄ NEXT PHASE OPTIONS

### **OPTION A: Continue Answering (Fast Track)**
```
Continue Q21-Q35 now (1-2 hours)
Then build complete module with full context (4-6 hours)
TOTAL: 5-8 hours sequential

PROS:
- Full context for all edge cases
- No rework needed
- Comprehensive from start

CONS:
- Longer wait before building starts
- More time in meetings
```

### **OPTION B: Start Building Now (Parallel)**
```
Build base + freight + lightspeed layers NOW (2 hours)
You answer Q21-Q35 in parallel (1-2 hours)
Then integrate answers into module (2 hours)
TOTAL: 5 hours total, work in parallel

PROS:
- Start building immediately
- Proven architecture early
- Faster feedback
- Parallelizes both our time

CONS:
- May need to refactor based on answers
- Less complete initial version
```

### **OPTION C: Full Build Later**
```
Answer all Q21-Q35 first (1-2 hours)
Then build complete module fully (4-6 hours)
TOTAL: 5-8 hours sequential, but comprehensive

PROS:
- Wait for all context
- Most efficient build
- Zero rework

CONS:
- Longest time to first version
```

## üèóÔ∏è WHAT CAN BE BUILT NOW (Without Q21-Q35)

I can autonomously build **2+ hours** of core infrastructure:

```
‚úÖ Base Module Pattern (30 min)
   - BaseController, BaseModel, BaseService
   - Traits: HasAuditLog, HasStatusTransitions, HasDraftStatus
   - ServiceProvider & IoC container
   - Inheritance template ready to use

‚úÖ Freight Integration Layer (30 min)
   - FreightIntegrationBridge (wrapper for 11 APIs)
   - FreightController endpoints
   - pack-freight.js UI class
   - Database schema for freight linking

‚úÖ Lightspeed Integration Layer (30 min)
   - LightspeedConsignmentBridge
   - ConsignmentRepository (query builder)
   - Webhook handlers
   - Sync logic

‚úÖ Data Models (30 min)
   - Consignment model (ORM)
   - Transfer model
   - Photo model
   - GRNI model

TOTAL: 2 hours of solid foundation
```

Then Q21-Q35 answers integrate into:
- Approval workflow logic
- Email notification templates
- Edge case handling
- Integration timing

## üìã WHAT Q21-Q35 WILL CONTROL

```
Q21-Q25: Multi-Tier Approval (affects)
  - Approval thresholds ($0-$2k, $2k-$5k, $5k+)
  - Approval workflow (who approves what)
  - Access control (role-based)
  - Escalation rules
  - Final approval workflow

Q26-Q30: Email Notifications (affects)
  - When emails sent (DRAFT, SENT, RECEIVED, etc)
  - Who gets notified (management, staff, finance)
  - Email templates (content, tone, data)
  - Digest vs real-time
  - Exception notifications

Q31-Q35: Integration & Edge Cases (affects)
  - Error handling & retries
  - Timeout rules
  - Rate limiting
  - Data sync strategies
  - Exception escalation
```

## üéØ MY RECOMMENDATION

**OPTION B: Start Building Now (Parallel)**

Why:
1. ‚úÖ **Faster feedback** - See working code in 2 hours
2. ‚úÖ **Parallelizes work** - You answer, I build simultaneously
3. ‚úÖ **Proven architecture** - Base/freight/lightspeed layers solid first
4. ‚úÖ **Flexible integration** - Easy to add Q21-Q35 logic later
5. ‚úÖ **Low risk** - Core components locked, business logic flexible
6. ‚úÖ **Momentum** - Building happens while you answer questions

**Timeline:**
```
NOW (parallel start):
  - I: Build base + freight + lightspeed (2 hours)
  - You: Answer Q21-Q35 (1-2 hours)

THEN:
  - I: Integrate approval workflow (1 hour)
  - I: Integrate email system (1 hour)
  - I: Integrate edge cases (1 hour)

THEN:
  - Test everything (1 hour)
  - Deploy to production (30 min)

TOTAL: 5-6 hours, with work happening in parallel
```

## ‚ú® WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

**Choose one:**

**A)** "Build now - I'll answer Q21-Q35 while you work"
‚Üí I start autonomous 2-hour build immediately

**B)** "Answer all Q21-Q35 first, then build complete"
‚Üí Continue with next batch of questions now

**C)** "Start building base, I'll continue answering"
‚Üí Build foundation layer (30 min) while you think about rest
