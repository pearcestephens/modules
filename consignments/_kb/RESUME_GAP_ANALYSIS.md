## üéì Key Context

### From Session 1, Remember:
- **DRAFT Status:** POs created as DRAFT, need confirmation to ACTIVE
- **Multi-Tier Approval:** $2k / $2k-$5k / $5k+ tiers
- **Lightspeed Sync:** At receive time, not PO creation
- **Smart Over-Receipt:** Auto-accept, no blocking
- **Freight Optional:** Per outlet, from invoice

These decisions impact Q13-Q35 answers!
