## 🔄 Exactly How to Resume

### The 3-Minute Restart Process

**Step 1:** Navigate
```bash
cd /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/public_html/modules
```

**Step 2:** Verify auto-push
```bash
php .auto-push-monitor.php status
# Expect: Status: 🟢 RUNNING
```

**Step 3:** Open resume guide
```
Read: consignments/_kb/RESUME_GAP_ANALYSIS.md
```

**Step 4:** Review previous answers
```
Read: consignments/_kb/PEARCE_ANSWERS_SESSION_1.md
```

**Step 5:** Ask Question 13
```
Topic: Signature Capture Requirements
- Technology? (Canvas, touchscreen, upload)
- Who signs? (Receiving staff, courier, both)
- Storage format? (PNG, SVG, Base64)
- Required or optional?
```

**Step 6:** Record answer
```bash
Edit: consignments/_kb/PEARCE_ANSWERS_SESSION_2.md
# Create if doesn't exist
# Follow format from SESSION_1 file
```

**Step 7:** Repeat
```
Questions 14-35 follow same pattern
Auto-push commits everything
```

## 📝 Important Context to Remember

### DRAFT Status Architecture (Key Decision!)
- POs created as DRAFT (not ACTIVE)
- Requires confirmation to become ACTIVE
- Impacts entire workflow design
- Critical for Questions 13-35

### Multi-Tier Approval
```
$0-$2k: Store Manager
$2k-$5k: Retail Ops Manager or Comms Manager
$5k+: Director
```

### Lightspeed Sync Timing
- Sync happens at **RECEIVE TIME** (not PO creation)
- Why: Real data available at receive
- Impact: Simplifies PO, complex at receive

### Over-Receipt Handling
- Auto-accept, no blocking
- Staff can receive more than ordered
- Flagged but allowed
