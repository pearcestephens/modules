## Question 13: Signature Capture & Authentication

**Question:** When a staff member completes a PO receipt, how should signatures be captured and stored?

**Your Answer:**

1. **Capture Method:**
   - ‚úÖ Checkbox + Staff ID Authentication
   - Simple auth mechanism, no complex drawing tools needed

2. **Who Signs:**
   - ‚úÖ Receiving Staff Member Only
   - Supplier/courier involvement not required

3. **Storage Format:**
   - ‚úÖ Audit Trail + PNG File System
   - Audit trail: Database logging of who, what, when
   - Signature image: PNG files stored in file system

4. **Required or Optional:**
   - ‚úÖ Depends on Outlet/Supplier + Configurable
   - Per-outlet configuration flexibility
   - Per-supplier configuration flexibility
   - Staff can disable if not needed for certain scenarios

**Implementation Notes:**

- Signature method: Checkbox + automatic staff_id linkage from session
- Storage:
  - Database: signature_timestamp, staff_id, receipt_id (audit trail)
  - File system: `/var/receipts/signatures/[outlet_id]/[receipt_id]/signature.png`
- Configuration:
  - Add `signature_required` flag to outlets table
  - Add `signature_required` flag to suppliers table
  - Signature field in DB: nullable (can be NULL if not required)
  - Audit log entry: Created for all signature actions regardless of requirement
- Audit Trail Schema:
  ```sql
  signature_audit_log (
    id,
    receipt_id,
    staff_id,
    outlet_id,
    supplier_id,
    signature_timestamp,
    signature_file_path,
    action (created|viewed|verified|rejected),
    created_at
  )
  ```

**Impact:**

- **Database:** Add signature configuration flags, audit trail table
- **File System:** Create signature storage directory structure
- **UI:** Checkbox + confirmation dialog before finalizing receipt
- **API:** POST endpoint to mark receipt as signed

**Status:** ‚úÖ Answered

## Question 14: Barcode Scanning Workflow

**Question:** When receiving goods, how should barcode scanning integrate? Should it be required, optional, or flexible?

**Your Answer:**

1. **Scanning Requirement:**
   - ‚úÖ Optional (Not Mandatory)
   - Users can choose to use barcode scanning or not
   - Manual entry must be fully supported as fallback
   - "Not a big deal" - flexibility is key
   - Easy to use BOTH styles (barcode-first and manual-first workflows)

2. **Barcode Format Support:**
   - ‚úÖ Any Barcode Type Supported
   - Not limited to specific formats
   - EAN-13, UPC, Code128, custom suppliers - all work
   - Flexible decoder (accept any valid barcode)

3. **Scan Verification Logic:**
   - ‚úÖ Accept ANY Quantity/Value
   - No blocking on quantity mismatches
   - MUST accept over-receipt without warnings
   - MUST accept under-receipt without warnings
   - Different audio tones for different scenarios:
     - **Tone 1:** When reaching expected QTY (success tone)
     - **Tone 2:** For unexpected products (alert tone)
     - **Tone 3:** For warnings/notices (gentle tone)
     - Additional visual feedback with tones
   - Operator always in control (no forced approval workflows)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Barcode Scanning as Optional Feature:
  - Toggle: "Enable barcode scanning" per outlet
  - UI: Dual-mode interface (manual + scan tabs)
  - Default: Manual entry, scan as enhancement

- Barcode Support:
  - Integration: PHP barcode decoder library (any format)
  - Processing: `barcode_decode(input) ‚Üí product_sku`
  - Lookup: Match SKU to product in PO
  - Flexible: Accept barcode that doesn't match product (override capable)

- Audio Feedback System:
  ```
  Scenario: Scanned item reaches PO qty ‚Üí Tone 1 (success beep)
  Scenario: Unexpected product scanned ‚Üí Tone 2 (alert beep)
  Scenario: System warning/info ‚Üí Tone 3 (gentle beep)
  ```

- Database:
  - Add `barcode_scanning_enabled` flag to outlets
  - Add `barcode_format_preference` (optional, not enforced)
  - Log: All scans recorded in audit trail with tone/result

- UI/UX:
  - Split interface: Manual entry on left, Scanner on right
  - Both work independently
  - Visual indicator: "Qty Complete" when reaching expected amount
  - Color changes: Green (complete), Yellow (warning), Red (info)
  - No error states - just guidance

**Impact:**

- **Database:** Minimal (configuration flags only)
- **Audio:** Integration with browser audio API or system sounds
- **UX:** Significant (dual-mode entry system with tone feedback)
- **Processing:** Simple barcode parsing (no complex validation)
