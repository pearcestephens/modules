## üéì LEARNING POINTS FROM DISCOVERY

### Key Insights:
1. **Lightspeed-Native Model:** System uses Lightspeed's native CONSIGNMENT, not separate PO tables (major simplification!)
2. **Freight Integration Already Exists:** Complete weight/volume/container/courier system already implemented
3. **Sync Timing is Critical:** All syncs happen AT RECEIVE TIME (not at creation), making process reversible
4. **Multi-Tier Approval:** 3-tier system with clear $ thresholds ($2k, $5k) already in Q1-Q12 answers
5. **DRAFT Status Pattern:** All transfers created as DRAFT initially, requiring explicit activation
6. **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns (API client, service layer, integrations)
7. **Comprehensive Audit Trail:** Every action logged in TRANSFER_AUDIT_LOG with full context

### Architecture Excellence:
- Idempotent operations (safe to retry)
- Exponential backoff for API retries
- Deterministic progress tracking
- Shadow table pattern for Lightspeed sync
- Proper error handling throughout
- Security measures (Bearer token, rate limiting)
