## üéØ CORE REQUIREMENTS

### A. TRANSFER TYPES (All 4 Must Be Supported)

#### 1. **Consignments** (Supplier Consignment)
- Supplier sends goods on consignment (not yet paid)
- Outlet receives goods into "Consignment Stock" bin
- Stock remains supplier property until sold/confirmed
- When sold: Convert to owned stock + trigger payment
- Database: `vend_consignments`, `consignment_items`, `consignment_status_log`

#### 2. **Stock Transfers** (Inter-Outlet or HQ‚ÜíOutlet)
- Transfer stock between outlets or from HQ to outlet
- Source outlet: Reduces inventory
- Destination outlet: Increases inventory
- Real-time sync across outlets
- Database: `stock_transfers`, `stock_transfer_items`, `transfer_status_log`

#### 3. **Staff Transfers** (Staff Personal Stock)
- Individual staff member transfers personal vape gear
- Tracked at staff_id level (not outlet level)
- Audit trail: Who transferred what to whom and when
- Database: `staff_transfers`, `staff_transfer_items`, `staff_transfer_log`

#### 4. **Purchase Orders (PO)** (Supplier Orders)
- Create PO for supplier
- Status progression: DRAFT ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí AWAITING_RECEIPT ‚Üí RECEIVED ‚Üí COMPLETED
- Multi-tier approval based on amount
- Receive goods against PO
- Database: `purchase_orders`, `po_items`, `po_status_log`

---

### B. BUSINESS LOGIC (From Q1-Q15 Answers)

#### User Roles & Permissions (5 Total)
1. **Director** - Can approve all POs, override any approval
2. **Comms Manager** - Can approve POs $2k-$5k
3. **Retail Ops Manager** - Can approve POs $2k-$5k
4. **Store Manager** - Can approve POs $0-$2k, receive goods
5. **Store Assistant** - Can perform receiving, assist with POs

#### Multi-Tier Approval System
```
PO Amount Range          Approval Required By
$0 - $2,000             Store Manager
$2,000 - $5,000         Retail Ops Manager OR Comms Manager
$5,000+                 Director ONLY
```

#### DRAFT Status Architecture ‚≠ê CRITICAL
- **POs created as DRAFT initially** (not ACTIVE)
- Must be explicitly confirmed/activated by authorized user
- DRAFT ‚Üí ACTIVE transition requires approval
- Workflow:
  1. User creates PO (status = DRAFT)
  2. System calculates required approval tier
  3. Notifies appropriate approver
  4. Approver reviews & confirms
  5. Status becomes ACTIVE
  6. Supplier notified
  7. Can receive against ACTIVE PO only

#### Lightspeed Sync Timing
- **Sync happens AT RECEIVE TIME** (not at PO creation)
- Real product/quantity data available only when goods physically received
- Sync includes: Product list, quantities, pricing updates
- Database event: `po_status_log` with 'lightspeed_synced' action
- Idempotent: Can sync multiple times, same result

#### Signature Capture
- **Method:** Checkbox + Staff ID authentication
- **Who signs:** Receiving staff member only
- **Storage:** Audit trail (DB) + PNG file system
- **Required:** Depends on outlet/supplier + configurable
- **Config flags:** `outlets.signature_required`, `suppliers.signature_required`
- **Audit table:** `signature_audit_log` (receipt_id, staff_id, timestamp, file_path)

#### Barcode Scanning
- **Requirement:** Optional (not mandatory)
- **Formats:** Support ANY barcode type (EAN-13, UPC, Code128, custom)
- **Verification Logic:** Accept ANY quantity/value (no blocking)
- **Audio Feedback:**
  - Tone 1: When reaching expected QTY (success)
  - Tone 2: Unexpected product (alert)
  - Tone 3: Warnings/info (gentle)
- **UI:** Dual-mode (manual entry + barcode scanning)
- **Config:** `outlets.barcode_scanning_enabled`

#### Email Notifications
- **Suppliers:** Receive email when PO becomes ACTIVE
- **Management:** Weekly automated overview report (Monday 6 AM or on-demand)
- **Store Manager:** Included in management report
- **System:** Leverage existing cron system (has many options)
- **Content:** PO status, receipts, exceptions, metrics
- **Flexibility:** Template customization per outlet

#### Over-Receipt Handling
- **Default:** Auto-accept any over-receipt (no blocking)
- **Behavior:** Flag for review but allow continuation
- **Notification:** Alert (not warning) sent to manager
- **No approval needed:** Auto-proceed with flagged status

#### Partial Deliveries
- **Allowed:** Unlimited partial deliveries per PO
- **Workflow:** Can receive partial qty, repeat multiple times
- **Status:** PO stays AWAITING_RECEIPT until 100% received
- **Flexibility:** Supplier can split shipments, outlet can receive incrementally

#### Freight Handling
- **Optional:** Not required
- **Per Outlet:** Can enable/disable per outlet
- **Source:** From invoice (not user-entered)
- **Format:** Flexible (text field, supports various formats)
- **Storage:** In PO receiving record, part of audit trail

#### Invoice Management
- **Storage:** File system (not database blob)
- **Retention:** 1 year retention policy
- **Format:** Accepted formats (PDF, images, etc.)
- **Matching:** Flag any PO ‚Üî Invoice mismatch
- **Approval:** Staff must approve/reject mismatches manually
- **Path:** `/invoices/[year]/[outlet_id]/[po_number]/`

#### Supplier Claims
- **Auto-generation:** Automatically create as DRAFT claim when issues found
- **Trigger:** Over-receipt, missing items, damaged goods, pricing discrepancies
- **Status:** DRAFT requires management approval before sending
- **Approval:** Management team must validate before sending to supplier
- **Tracking:** Full audit log of claim lifecycle

#### Product Photos
- **Quantity:** 5 photos per product (during receiving)
- **Auto-resize:** To 1080p max dimension
- **Format:** JPEG or PNG
- **Storage:** File system `/photos/products/[outlet_id]/[po_id]/[product_id]/`
- **UI:** Gallery view, can rotate/reorder
- **Optional:** Not required, but captured when available

### D. CRISLOGGER INTEGRATION (AI Logging)

**Every significant action must be logged via CISLogger:**

```php
// Example: When PO is created
CISLogger::log([
    'entity_type' => 'purchase_order',
    'entity_id' => $po->id,
    'action' => 'created',
    'actor_id' => auth()->user()->id,
    'actor_role' => auth()->user()->role,
    'details' => [
        'po_number' => $po->po_number,
        'supplier_id' => $po->supplier_id,
        'outlet_id' => $po->outlet_id,
        'total_amount' => $po->total_amount,
        'approval_tier' => $po->approval_required_tier,
        'status' => $po->status,
    ],
    'timestamp' => now(),
    'ip_address' => request()->ip(),
]);

// Example: When PO status changes to ACTIVE
CISLogger::log([
    'entity_type' => 'purchase_order',
    'entity_id' => $po->id,
    'action' => 'status_changed',
    'status_from' => 'DRAFT',
    'status_to' => 'ACTIVE',
    'actor_id' => $approver->id,
    'reason' => 'PO Approved',
    'details' => [
        'approval_tier' => $po->approval_required_tier,
        'approver_role' => $approver->role,
    ],
]);

// Example: When goods are received
CISLogger::log([
    'entity_type' => 'po_receiving',
    'entity_id' => $receiving->id,
    'action' => 'goods_received',
    'actor_id' => $receiving_staff->id,
    'details' => [
        'po_id' => $po->id,
        'items_received' => count($receiving_items),
        'over_receipt_count' => count($over_receipts),
        'photos_captured' => $photo_count,
        'signature_captured' => $receiving->signature_captured,
        'barcode_scans' => $barcode_scan_count,
    ],
]);

// Example: When Lightspeed is synced
CISLogger::log([
    'entity_type' => 'purchase_order',
    'entity_id' => $po->id,
    'action' => 'lightspeed_synced',
    'system' => 'lightspeed_retail',
    'details' => [
        'items_synced' => count($po_items),
        'sync_duration_ms' => $duration,
        'sync_status' => 'success',
    ],
]);
```

## üìù FINAL NOTES

This is a **complete, production-ready specification**. The coding agent should:

1. **Create all database tables** with proper relationships
2. **Implement all APIs** with full validation
3. **Build all UI components** (clean, responsive Bootstrap 4.2)
4. **Integrate CISLogger** on every significant action
5. **Test everything** before opening PR
6. **Document thoroughly** (code + user guide)
7. **Handle errors gracefully** (no silent failures)
8. **Optimize performance** (indexed queries, caching where appropriate)
9. **Follow existing code patterns** in the project
10. **Deploy to main branch** when complete

**The result should be a fully functional, battle-tested Consignments Module that's ready for real-world use immediately.**
