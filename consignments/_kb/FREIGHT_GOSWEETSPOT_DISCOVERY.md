## Critical Information to Capture

### 1. **GoSweetSpot & NZ Post Integration**
**Location:** Services directory (alongside existing Freight API)

**Key Details Pearce Flagged:**
- GoSweetSpot (NZ Couriers) integration

- Weight/volume calculations work in tandem with these
- **These should be USED TOGETHER** (not separate)

**Action Required:**

### 2. **Email Template Design**
**Location:** stock-transfer-functions.php (bottom of file)

**Details Pearce Flagged:**
- There are TWO email templates at bottom
- Use the "more modern looking one" (not the older one)
- This is Pearce's preferred style for email design
- Should be adopted for Q27 email template spec

**Action Required:**
- Find stock-transfer-functions.php (in shared or consignments module)
- Scroll to bottom
