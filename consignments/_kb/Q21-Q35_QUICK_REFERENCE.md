## 🚀 HOW TO ANSWER

**Each question follows this pattern:**

```
## QUESTION XX: [Topic]

### The Question
[Detailed explanation + multiple sub-questions]

### ✅ PEARCE'S ANSWER
(Just type your response here!)
```

### Simple Format - 3 Options Per Question:

**OPTION 1: Quick Answer (Recommended)**
```
[Just state your preference/decision in 1-2 sentences]

Example Q21:
"Thresholds: $0-$2k auto, $2k-$10k manager approval, $10k+ director approval"
```

**OPTION 2: Detailed Answer**
```
[1-2 paragraphs with reasoning and specifics]

Example Q26:
"Emails for: DRAFT creation (to manager), SENT to supplier (to creator),
RECEIVED (to finance). Real-time for approvals, digest daily for everything else."
```

**OPTION 3: "Keep It Simple" Answer**
```
[Just say "No approval needed" or "Whatever you recommend" or "Figure it out"]

I'll use sensible defaults if you don't have strong opinion on something.

```
Q21 (Thresholds): No approval needed (all auto-approved)
Q22 (Roles): Managers can approve, staff can create
Q23 (Escalation): No timeout, no auto-escalation
Q24 (Rejection): Can resubmit immediately
Q25 (Notifications): Email on approval events only

Q26 (When/To Whom): SENT to supplier, RECEIVED to finance/manager
Q27 (Templates): Professional, full PO details
Q28 (Digest): Real-time for urgent, daily digest for routine
Q29 (Exceptions): Email manager on errors
Q30 (Integration): Async with retry, sync for critical paths

Q31 (Validation): Warn but allow override
Q32 (Rate Limit): No hard limits
Q33 (Backup): Daily backup, 30-day retention
Q34 (Audit): Log everything, 1-year retention
Q35 (Performance): Standard web targets (< 2s pages, < 500ms API)
```
