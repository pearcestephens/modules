# 🎯 Flagged Products Module - Cron Audit Complete

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Audit Scope:** All 5 cron tasks in `/modules/flagged_products/cron/`  
**Critical Issue:** Unsafe `deleted_at IS NULL` checks throughout codebase  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL FIXED**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

### Critical Data Integrity Issue Discovered
The `deleted_at` field in CIS has **THREE different values** representing "not deleted":
- `NULL` - Not deleted
- `'0000-00-00 00:00:00'` - Not deleted (Vend default)
- `''` (empty string) - Not deleted (legacy)

**Problem:** Most code only checked `deleted_at IS NULL`, missing active records with `'0000-00-00'`.

**Impact:**
- Active products excluded from flagged products generation
- Active outlets excluded from leaderboards/stats
- Inaccurate inventory reports
- Wrong product selection

**Solution:** Replaced all unsafe checks with:
```sql
(deleted_at IS NULL OR deleted_at = '0000-00-00 00:00:00' OR deleted_at = '')
```

## 🚀 5 Cron Tasks - Complete Overview

### 1. **generate_daily_products.php** ⭐ CRITICAL
**Schedule:** Daily at 7:05 AM  
**Priority:** 1 (highest)  
**Purpose:** Generate 20 smart flagged products per outlet per day

**Algorithm (8 Strategies):**
1. **Verify Zero Stock** (10%) - Items showing 0, verify if true
2. **Critical Low** (15%) - 1-4 units, almost out
3. **Teetering** (10%) - 5-7 units, on the edge
4. **Fast-Moving** (20%) - 5+ sales/week, high velocity
5. **Slow-Moving** (10%) - No sales in 30 days, dead stock?
6. **High-Value** (10%) - Price >$100, expensive = important
7. **Recently Sold Out** (5%) - Had stock, now 0
8. **Smart Random** (20%) - Day-based variety:
   - Mon/Fri: Popular brands (SMOK, Geek Vape, Vaporesso, IGET)
   - Tue/Sat: Moderate stock (8-15 units)
   - Wed/Sun: Mid-price range ($20-60)
   - Thu: Pure random

**Outlet Validation:**
- ✅ `flags_enabled = 1` (configurable per outlet)
- ✅ `>10 sales in last 7 days` (active outlet check)

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### 1. Add Required Database Columns (HIGH PRIORITY)
```sql
ALTER TABLE vend_outlets 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS flags_enabled TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1 COMMENT 'Enable/disable flagged products for this outlet';

ALTER TABLE vend_outlets 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS flags_per_day INT DEFAULT 20 COMMENT 'Number of products to flag per day for this outlet';
```

**File:** `/modules/flagged_products/sql/add_outlet_settings.sql` (already created)

---

### 2. Register Cron Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
cd /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/public_html/modules/flagged_products/cron
php register_tasks.php
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Registered: generate_daily_products (7:05 AM)
✅ Registered: refresh_leaderboard (2:00 AM)
✅ Registered: generate_ai_insights (hourly)
✅ Registered: check_achievements (every 6h)
✅ Registered: refresh_store_stats (every 30m)
```

---

### 3. Manual Test Run (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
cd /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/public_html/modules/flagged_products/cron
php generate_daily_products.php
```

**Verify:**
1. Check logs: `tail -100 /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/public_html/logs/flagged_products_cron.log`
2. Check database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flagged_products WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;`
3. Verify reason breakdown: Should see mix of critical_low, fast_moving, random, etc.
4. Check outlet validation: Inactive outlets should be skipped

---

### 4. Customize Outlet Settings (OPTIONAL)
Update specific outlets if needed:

```sql
-- Disable flagged products for a specific outlet
UPDATE vend_outlets 
SET flags_enabled = 0 
WHERE id = 123;

-- Change daily product count for high-volume store
UPDATE vend_outlets 
SET flags_per_day = 30 
WHERE name = 'Auckland Central';

-- Only flag 10 products for small stores
UPDATE vend_outlets 
SET flags_per_day = 10 
WHERE name IN ('Small Store 1', 'Small Store 2');
```

---

### 5. Monitor First Automated Run
**When:** Tomorrow morning at 7:05 AM

**What to Check:**
1. Cron execution logs
2. Product generation success rate
3. Variety in product reasons (not all same)
4. Day-based rotation working (check what day it is)
5. Outlet-specific counts matching flags_per_day

**Monitoring Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    o.name AS outlet,
    COUNT(*) AS products_generated,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT f.reason) AS reasons
FROM flagged_products f
JOIN vend_outlets o ON f.outlet_id = o.id
WHERE f.created_at > CURDATE()
GROUP BY o.id, o.name
ORDER BY products_generated DESC;
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: No products generated
**Check:**
1. `flags_enabled = 1` for outlet?
2. Outlet has >10 sales in last 7 days?
3. Products exist in vend_products for that outlet?
4. Check logs for errors

---

### Issue: Same products every day
**Check:**
1. Day-based rotation working? (print `date('w')` in log)
2. Reason breakdown varied? (should see 8 different reasons)
3. Random seed correct? (should change daily)

---

### Issue: Wrong number of products
**Check:**
1. `flags_per_day` setting in vend_outlets
2. Quota calculation (sum of all strategy percentages should = 100%)
3. Some strategies might have 0 results (e.g., no high-value items)

---

### Issue: Deleted products appearing
**Check:**
1. This should be FIXED now with safe deleted_at check
2. Verify product has NULL or '0000-00-00' in deleted_at
3. Check product active = 1
