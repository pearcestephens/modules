---

## 📊 Expected Business Impact

### Month 1
- **10-15 actionable insights per day**
- **2-3 critical issues detected early**
- **15-20 hours saved** (vs manual analysis)
- **$2K-5K cost avoided** (stockouts, issues prevented)
- **2-3 process improvements** identified

### Month 3
- **15-25% efficiency improvement**
- **40% faster onboarding** (knowledge sharing)
- **50% reduction** in burnout incidents
- **Proactive issue prevention** (not just reaction)
- **Data-driven decisions** (not gut feel)

### ROI Example

```
Time Saved:
  10 issues × 2 hours investigation = 20 hours = $1,000

Cost Avoided:
  3 stockouts prevented × $500 = $1,500

Revenue Captured:
  2 slow movers cleared × $2,000 = $4,000

Total Benefit = $6,500
Investment = 2 hours setup + (5 min/day × 30) = 4.5 hours = $225
ROI = ($6,500 - $225) / $225 × 100% = 2,789%
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### How Insights Are Generated

1. **Data Collection**
   - Queries vend_sales, vend_inventory, stock_transfers, etc.
   - 30-day time windows
   - Store-by-store analysis

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Compares current vs historical data
   - Threshold-based triggers (>15% change, >48hr delays, etc.)
   - Statistical significance checks

3. **AI Analysis**
   - Asks AI "why" using semantic search
   - Gets recommendations using AI reasoning
   - Calculates confidence scores

4. **Insight Creation**
   - Structured format (type, priority, title, description)
   - Evidence included (data sources, sample sizes)
   - Recommendations with expected impact
   - Expiry date (7 days default)

5. **Lifecycle Tracking**
   - Status: new → reviewed → actioned/dismissed
   - Outcomes recorded
   - Learning feedback loop

### How Natural Language Q&A Works

1. **Question asked** (e.g., "Why are sales down?")
2. **Semantic search** runs on AI hub
3. **Relevant insights** returned (with similarity scores)
4. **AI summarizes** the answer
5. **Confidence** and sources included

### How ROI Is Calculated

```
Benefit = Time Saved + Cost Avoided + Revenue Captured

Time Saved = Issues detected early × Avg investigation time
Cost Avoided = Problems prevented × Avg cost per problem
Revenue Captured = Opportunities taken × Avg value

Investment = Setup time + Daily review time

ROI = (Benefit - Investment) / Investment × 100%
```

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Adding Custom Insights

Create new analysis method in AIBusinessInsightsService.php:

```php
private function analyzeCustomMetric(): ?array
{
    // 1. Query your data
    $data = $this->db->query("SELECT ...");

    // 2. Detect pattern
    if ($data['threshold_exceeded']) {

        // 3. Ask AI for analysis
        $reasoning = $this->ai->ask(
            "Analyze why [metric] is [state]. Consider [factors]."
        );

        // 4. Generate recommendations
        $recommendations = [
            ['action' => '...', 'impact' => '...'],
        ];

        // 5. Return insight array
        return [
            'insight_type' => 'custom_metric',
            'priority' => 'high',
            'title' => 'Custom Insight Title',
            'description' => 'What we found...',
            'recommendations' => $recommendations,
            'confidence_score' => 0.85,
            // ... etc
        ];
    }

    return null;
}
```

Then call it from `generateDailyInsights()`:

```php
public function generateDailyInsights(): array
{
    $insights = [];

    // Existing analyzers
    $insights = array_merge($insights, $this->analyzeSalesPerformance() ?? []);
    $insights = array_merge($insights, $this->analyzeInventoryIntelligence() ?? []);
    $insights = array_merge($insights, $this->analyzeOperationalEfficiency() ?? []);

    // Your custom analyzer
    if ($custom = $this->analyzeCustomMetric()) {
        $insights[] = $custom;
    }

    return $insights;
}
```

### Adjusting Thresholds

Edit constants in AIBusinessInsightsService.php:

```php
// More sensitive (more insights)
private const SALES_DECLINE_THRESHOLD = 0.10;  // 10% instead of 15%

// Less sensitive (fewer insights)
private const SALES_DECLINE_THRESHOLD = 0.25;  // 25% instead of 15%

// Inventory thresholds
private const SLOW_MOVER_MIN_STOCK = 100;  // Higher minimum
private const SLOW_MOVER_MAX_SALES = 3;    // Stricter sales requirement

// Time thresholds
private const TRANSFER_DELAY_THRESHOLD = 72;    // 72 hours instead of 48
private const CONSIGNMENT_TIME_THRESHOLD = 45;  // 45 minutes instead of 60
```
