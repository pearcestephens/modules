1. **Save before experimenting** - Always save a version before trying risky changes
2. **Use clear commit messages** - "Updated button hover states" not "changes"
3. **Components are your friend** - Build once, reuse everywhere
4. **Core is sacred** - Never edit base.css (use custom CSS variables)
5. **Test rollback** - Try rolling back to get comfortable with the process
