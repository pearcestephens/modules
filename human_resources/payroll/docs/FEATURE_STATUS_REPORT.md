### 4. Overtime Calculation ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE and TESTED
**Files:**
- `services/PayslipCalculationEngine.php` - calculateEarnings() method
- Lines 115-126: Overtime logic

**Implementation:**
```php
// Ordinary hours (capped at 8 per day)
$ordinaryHours = min($workedHours, 8.0);
$overtimeHours = max(0, $workedHours - 8.0);

$ordinaryPay += $ordinaryHours * $hourlyRate;
$overtimePay += $overtimeHours * $hourlyRate * 1.5; // Time and a half
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ 8-hour per day cap on ordinary hours
- ✅ Anything over 8 hours = overtime
- ✅ Time and a half (1.5x) rate for overtime
- ✅ Correctly tracked in payslip
- ✅ Tested in Deputy algorithm tests (12h, 14h scenarios)

**Example:**
- Work 12 hours with 60min break = 11 hours worked
  - Ordinary: 8 hours @ $25 = $200

**Special Cases:**
- Worked alone: NO break deduction ✅
- Paid break outlets [18, 13, 15]: NO deduction ✅
- Paid break staff [483, 492, 485, 459, 103]: NO deduction ✅
- Existing recorded break: HONOR it (don't override) ✅

**Test Results:**
```
✅ PASS: < 5 hours worked = NO break deduction
✅ PASS: Exactly 5 hours = 30 min break
✅ PASS: 8 hours = 30 min break (not 60)
✅ PASS: Exactly 12 hours = 60 min break
✅ PASS: 14 hours = 60 min break
✅ PASS: Worked ALONE = NO break deduction
✅ PASS: Paid break outlet (18) = NO deduction
✅ PASS: Paid break staff (483) = NO deduction
✅ PASS: Existing break = HONOR it (don't override)
✅ PASS: 4.5 hours = NO break (fixed from 4.0 threshold bug)

Total: 10/10 PASSING 🎉
```

---

### 6. Night Shift Loading ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files:**
- `services/PayslipCalculationEngine.php` - calculateNightShiftHours() method

    $altHolidaysEntitled++;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Time and a half rate (1.5x)
- ✅ Alternative holiday entitlement earned
- ✅ Tracks public holiday hours separately

---

## 🤔 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### 1. Petty Cash / Expenses System 🤔

**Status:** Database exists but NOT integrated with payroll
**Database Table:** `petty_cash_expenses`

**Current Structure:**
```
- id (int, auto_increment)
- outlet_id (varchar 45)
- created_at (timestamp)
- total_cash (decimal 10,2)
- xero_invoice_id (varchar 45)
- deleted_at (timestamp)
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ NOT linked to staff (no staff_id)
- ❌ NOT linked to payslips (no payslip_id)
- ❌ NOT linked to pay periods
- ❌ No expense type/category
- ❌ No approval workflow
- ❌ No fuel/mileage tracking
- ❌ Xero invoice ID present but purpose unclear

**Conclusion:** This appears to be an OUTLET-LEVEL petty cash tracking system, NOT a staff expense reimbursement system.

---

## ❌ MISSING FEATURES

### 1. Fuel Reimbursements ❌

**Status:** DOES NOT EXIST
**Evidence:**
- ❌ No fuel_reimbursements table
- ❌ No travel_expenses table
- ❌ No mileage_claims table
- ❌ No code mentions "fuel" or "reimbursement" in Deputy or payroll files
- ❌ No API endpoints for fuel claims
- ❌ No controller for reimbursements
- ❌ No service for expense management

**What Needs Building:**

#### A. Database Table: `payroll_fuel_reimbursements`
```sql
CREATE TABLE payroll_fuel_reimbursements (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    staff_id INT NOT NULL,
    pay_period_id INT NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,

    -- Trip details
    from_location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    to_location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    purpose VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

    -- Distance/rate
    kilometers DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    rate_per_km DECIMAL(10,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.95, -- IRD rate 2025: $0.95/km

    -- Calculation
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,

    -- Approval workflow
    status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'declined') DEFAULT 'pending',
    submitted_by INT NOT NULL,
    submitted_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    reviewed_by INT NULL,
    reviewed_at DATETIME NULL,
    decline_reason TEXT NULL,

    -- Payment tracking
    paid_in_payslip_id INT NULL,

    -- Supporting docs
    has_receipt TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0,
    receipt_attachment VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    notes TEXT NULL,

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    FOREIGN KEY (staff_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (pay_period_id) REFERENCES pay_periods(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (submitted_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (reviewed_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (paid_in_payslip_id) REFERENCES payroll_payslips(id),

    INDEX idx_staff_period (staff_id, pay_period_id),
    INDEX idx_status (status),
    INDEX idx_date (date)
);
```

#### B. Service Class: `FuelReimbursementService.php`
```php
Methods needed:
- createClaim(staffId, payPeriodId, date, from, to, km, purpose, notes)
- getClaim(claimId)
- getClaimsByStaff(staffId, payPeriodId)
- getPendingClaims(payPeriodId)
- approveClaim(claimId, approvedBy)
- declineClaim(claimId, declinedBy, reason)
- calculateAmount(kilometers, ratePerKm)
- getUnpaidClaims(staffId, payPeriodId)
- markAsPaid(claimId, payslipId)
```

#### C. Controller Class: `FuelReimbursementController.php`
```php
API Endpoints needed:
POST /api/payroll/fuel-reimbursements/create
GET /api/payroll/fuel-reimbursements/:id
GET /api/payroll/fuel-reimbursements/pending
GET /api/payroll/fuel-reimbursements/staff/:staffId
POST /api/payroll/fuel-reimbursements/:id/approve
POST /api/payroll/fuel-reimbursements/:id/decline
```

#### D. Integration Points:
1. **PayslipService** needs to include fuel reimbursements in total pay
2. **PayslipCalculationEngine** should add unpaid fuel reimbursements to payslip
3. **BankExportService** should include fuel reimbursements in export
4. **Routes** need fuel reimbursement endpoints
5. **UI** needs forms for:
   - Submit fuel claim
   - Review pending claims
   - View claim history

---

### 2. Mileage Tracking ❌

**Status:** DOES NOT EXIST
**Related:** Would work alongside fuel reimbursements

**What Needs Building:**
- Vehicle registration (make, model, license plate)
- Odometer readings (start/end of trip)
- Trip log (date, from, to, km, purpose)
- Rate management (different rates for different vehicle types?)
- Receipt upload for fuel purchases

---

### 3. General Expense Claims ❌

**Status:** DOES NOT EXIST
**Scope:** Non-fuel expenses (accommodation, meals, etc.)

**What Needs Building:**
- Expense categories (fuel, accommodation, meals, parking, tools, supplies)
- Receipt requirements per category
- Approval limits (e.g., >$100 needs manager approval)
- Tax treatment (GST/taxable vs non-taxable)
- Integration with Xero expense claims

---

## 📋 ADVANCED DEPUTY FEATURES (Documented but Not Implemented)

### 1. Multiple Shifts Logic ⏳

**Status:** DOCUMENTED but not implemented
**Source:** DEPUTY_ALGORITHM_DOCUMENTATION.md
**Logic:** When staff works multiple shifts in one day, only the LONGEST shift gets break deducted

**Example:**
- Shift 1: 3 hours (no break - too short)
- Shift 2: 6 hours (would normally get 30min break)
- **Result:** Break only deducted from 6-hour shift, not both

**Why Not Implemented:** Current implementation processes each timesheet independently

---

### 2. Store Hours Enforcement ⏳

**Status:** DOCUMENTED but not implemented
**Source:** DEPUTY_ALGORITHM_DOCUMENTATION.md
**Logic:** Clamp shift times to outlet opening hours, EXCEPT for staff 456, 469

**Example:**
- Store opens 9am-5pm
- Timesheet: 8am-6pm
- **Result:** Clamped to 9am-5pm UNLESS staff is 456 or 469 (managers who can work outside hours)

**Why Not Implemented:** Not critical for payroll accuracy

---

### 3. Split Shift Merging ⏳

**Status:** DOCUMENTED but not implemented
**Source:** DEPUTY_ALGORITHM_DOCUMENTATION.md
**Logic:** When amendment covers 2+ timesheets, merge them into one

**Example:**
- Original: 9am-1pm (4h) + 2pm-6pm (4h) = two timesheets
- Amendment: 9am-6pm with 30min break = one merged timesheet

**Why Not Implemented:** Amendment system doesn't handle split shifts yet

---

### 4. Approved Timesheet Handling ⏳

**Status:** DOCUMENTED but not implemented
**Source:** DEPUTY_ALGORITHM_DOCUMENTATION.md
**Logic:** Cannot UPDATE approved timesheets - must CREATE NEW instead

**Why Not Implemented:** Deputy sync currently updates regardless of approval status

---
