## üî¢ Break Calculation Rules

### Core Algorithm
```php
function calculateDeputyHourBreaksInMinutesBasedOnHoursWorked(float $hoursWorked): int {
    if ($hoursWorked < getCurrentThresholdForFirstBreak()) return 0;    // < 5 hours = 0 min
    if ($hoursWorked < getCurrentThresholdForSecondBreak()) return 30;  // 5-12 hours = 30 min
    return 60;                                                          // 12+ hours = 60 min
}
```

### Break Thresholds
- **First Break Threshold:** `5.0 hours`
- **Second Break Threshold:** `12.0 hours`

**Break Schedule:**
| Hours Worked | Break Time |
|--------------|------------|
| < 5 hours    | 0 minutes  |
| 5-12 hours   | 30 minutes |
| 12+ hours    | 60 minutes |

## üë§ Working Alone vs With Others

### The Critical Rule
**This is the most important part of the Deputy algorithm:**

```
IF staff member worked ALONE during their shift:
    ‚Üí They get PAID for their breaks (no break deduction)

IF staff member worked WITH OTHERS during their shift:
    ‚Üí Auto-deduct break time based on hours worked
```

### How "Alone" is Determined

A staff member is considered "working alone" if:
1. Their shift has **NO overlapping shifts** from other staff
2. At the **same outlet/location**
3. During **any part of their shift time**

**Algorithm:**
```php
function isWorkingAlone($staffId, $startTime, $endTime, $outlet): bool {
    // Check all other timesheets at same outlet
    foreach ($allTimesheetsAtOutlet as $otherTimesheet) {
        if ($otherTimesheet->staffId === $staffId) {
            continue; // Skip self
        }

        // Check for time overlap
        if ($otherTimesheet->startTime <= $endTime &&
            $otherTimesheet->endTime >= $startTime) {
            return false; // NOT alone - someone else was there
        }
    }

    return true; // Worked alone
}
```

### Time Overlap Detection

Three scenarios for overlap:
```php
// Overlap occurs if ANY of these conditions are true:
1. (otherStart < myEnd) AND (otherEnd > myStart)     // Partial overlap
2. (otherStart >= myStart) AND (otherStart < myEnd)  // Other started during my shift
3. (otherEnd > myStart) AND (otherEnd <= myEnd)      // Other ended during my shift
```

---

## üîÑ Multiple Shifts Logic

### Scenario: Staff Works Multiple Shifts Same Day

**Rule:** Only the **longest shift** of the day gets the break deduction.

**Example:**
```
Staff works:
- Shift 1: 9am-1pm (4 hours)
- Shift 2: 5pm-10pm (5 hours)

Total: 9 hours worked
‚Üí Only Shift 2 (longest) gets 30 min break deducted
‚Üí Shift 1 keeps full 4 hours paid
```

**Algorithm:**
```php
function determineIfMultipleShiftsAndAssignBreak(array $timesheets): array {
    // Group by staff member
    foreach ($staffShifts as $staffId => $shifts) {
        $totalHours = array_sum(array_column($shifts, 'hours'));
        $maxShiftHours = max(array_column($shifts, 'hours'));

        // If total qualifies for break AND multiple shifts
        if ($totalHours >= 5.0 && count($shifts) > 1) {
            // Only apply break to LONGEST shift
            foreach ($shifts as $shift) {
                if ($shift->hours === $maxShiftHours) {
                    $shift->needsBreakDeducted = true;
                } else {
                    $shift->needsBreakDeducted = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üí∞ Paid Break Policy

### Locations with Paid Breaks
Certain outlets **always** pay breaks (no deduction):
```php
$locationsAcceptPaidBreaks = [18, 13, 15]; // Outlet IDs
```

### Staff with Paid Breaks
Certain staff members **always** get paid breaks:
```php
$staffAcceptPaidBreaks = [483, 492, 485, 459, 103]; // Staff user IDs
```

### Logic Flow
```
1. Calculate break normally based on hours
2. Check if staff worked alone ‚Üí If yes, paid break (0 min deduction)
3. Check if outlet is in paid break list ‚Üí If yes, paid break (0 min deduction)
4. Check if staff is in paid break list ‚Üí If yes, paid break (0 min deduction)
5. Otherwise ‚Üí Apply calculated break deduction
```

**Priority Order:**
1. Already recorded break time (honor existing)
2. Paid break policy (location or staff)
3. Worked alone rule
4. Standard calculation

## üîß Timesheet Update Logic

### Approved vs Draft Timesheets

**Critical Deputy Limitation:** Approved timesheets **CANNOT** be updated via API.

**Solution:**
```php
if (timesheet is APPROVED) {
    // Create NEW timesheet with updated times
    $newTimesheet = deputyCreateTimeSheet(...);

    // Approve the new one
    deputyApproveTimeSheet($newTimesheet->id);

    // Note: Old timesheet remains (manual cleanup needed)
} else {
    // Timesheet is DRAFT - can update directly
    updateDeputyTimeSheet(...);
}
```

### Merging Split Shifts

When an amendment **completely covers** multiple separate timesheets:

```php
// Example: Amendment covers 9am-5pm, but Deputy has:
// Timesheet 1: 9am-1pm
// Timesheet 2: 2pm-5pm

// Solution: CREATE ONE MERGED TIMESHEET
$mergedTimesheet = deputyCreateTimeSheet(
    $staffId,
    $amendmentStart,  // 9am
    $amendmentEnd,    // 5pm
    $breakMinutes,    // Calculated for full 8 hours
    $outletId,
    'Merged via CIS: Combined 2 split shifts'
);

// Old timesheets remain in Deputy (no auto-delete API)
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Special Cases & Edge Handling

### 1. Store Opening Hours Enforcement

Some staff timesheets are **clamped** to store hours:
```php
$staffIgnoreStartFinish = [456, 469]; // Staff IDs that bypass this rule

if (!in_array($staffId, $staffIgnoreStartFinish)) {
    // Clamp start time to store opening
    if ($shiftStart < $storeOpen) {
        $shiftStart = $storeOpen;
    }

    // Clamp end time to store closing
    if ($shiftEnd > $storeClose) {
        $shiftEnd = $storeClose;
    }
}
```

### 2. Existing Break Time Priority

If Deputy already has a break recorded, **honor it**:
```php
if ($timesheet->totalBreakTime > 0) {
    $breakMinutes = $timesheet->totalBreakTime * 60; // Convert hours to minutes
    // DON'T recalculate
}
```

### 3. Overnight Shifts

Shifts crossing midnight are handled:
```php
if ($endTime < $startTime) {
    $endTime += 86400; // Add 24 hours (1 day in seconds)
}

$hoursWorked = ($endTime - $startTime) / 3600;
```

### 4. Discarding Unsubmitted Rosters

After processing timesheets, clean up Deputy roster entries:
```php
// Find all unsubmitted roster entries in the same time window
$unsubmittedRosters = getUnsubmittedRosteredTimesheets($start, $end);

// Discard them (they're replaced by actual timesheets)
deputyDiscardRoster($rosterIds);
```

## üíª Implementation Details

### Database Structure

**deputy_timesheets table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE deputy_timesheets (
    id                   BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    deputy_timesheet_id  BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    staff_id             INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    outlet_id            INT NULL,

### New PayslipCalculationEngine Implementation

```php
class PayslipCalculationEngine {
    /**
     * Calculate earnings with Deputy break logic
     */
    public function calculateEarnings(array $timesheets, int $staffId): array {
        foreach ($timesheets as $timesheet) {
            $date = $timesheet['date'];
            $startTime = $timesheet['start_time'];
            $endTime = $timesheet['end_time'];
            $breakHours = (float)($timesheet['break_hours'] ?? 0.0);
            $hourlyRate = (float)($timesheet['hourly_rate'] ?? 0.0);

            // DEPUTY BREAK LOGIC: Check if worked alone
            $workedAlone = $this->didStaffWorkAlone($staffId, $date, $startTime, $endTime);

            // Calculate total hours
            $totalHours = $this->calculateHoursBetween($startTime, $endTime);

            // Apply Deputy break rule
            if (!$workedAlone && $totalHours >= 4.0 && $breakHours === 0.0) {
                // Auto-deduct 30 min if worked with others for 4+ hours
                $breakHours = 0.5;
            }

            $workedHours = $totalHours - $breakHours;

            // Continue with earnings calculation...
        }
    }

    /**
     * Check if staff member worked alone during shift
     *
     * NZ Employment Law / Deputy Rule:
     * - If worked ALONE = paid breaks (no deduction)

     */
    private function didStaffWorkAlone(
        int $staffId,
        string $date,
        string $startTime,
        string $endTime
    ): bool {
        // Get staff member's outlet
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare("SELECT default_outlet FROM users WHERE id = ?");
        $stmt->execute([$staffId]);
        $outlet = $stmt->fetchColumn();

        if (!$outlet) {
            return false; // Assume worked with others (safer for compliance)
        }

        // Check for overlapping shifts at same outlet
        $stmt = $this->db->prepare("
            SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM deputy_timesheets dt
            JOIN users u ON dt.staff_id = u.id
            WHERE dt.date = ?
            AND dt.staff_id != ?
            AND (u.default_outlet = ? OR dt.outlet_id = ?)
            AND (

        $overlappingStaff = (int)$stmt->fetchColumn();

        return $overlappingStaff === 0; // True if no overlapping staff found
    }
}
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Break calculation is hours-based:** < 5h = 0, 5-12h = 30min, 12h+ = 60min
2. **Worked alone = paid breaks:** No deduction if no other staff at outlet during shift
3. **Multiple shifts = longest gets break:** Only deduct from longest shift of the day
4. **Certain outlets/staff always paid:** Policy overrides standard rules
5. **Approved timesheets can't be updated:** Must create new ones instead
6. **Existing breaks are honored:** Don't recalculate if already set
7. **Store hours enforced:** Most staff clamped to opening hours (some exempt)
8. **Merging covers replacement:** One timesheet for multi-shift amendments

---

## üö® Important Notes

### NZ Employment Law Compliance
- Staff working alone must be paid for breaks (health & safety requirement)
- Auto-deducting breaks when working with others is legally compliant
- Minimum 30-minute break for shifts 5+ hours
- Additional break for shifts 12+ hours

### Deputy API Limitations
- **NO** unapprove endpoint exists
- **CANNOT** update approved timesheets
- **CANNOT** delete timesheets via API reliably
- **MUST** create new timesheets to replace approved ones

### Performance Considerations
- Cache outlet opening hours (don't query every timesheet)
- Batch overlapping staff queries by date
- Index deputy_timesheets on (staff_id, date, outlet_id)
- Consider Redis caching for "worked alone" checks

## üìä Testing Examples

### Test Case 1: Worked Alone
```
Staff: Alice (ID: 1)
Outlet: Hamilton (ID: 1)
Shift: 9am-5pm (8 hours)
Other staff at outlet: None

Expected:
- Total hours: 8.0
- Break deduction: 0.0 (worked alone = paid break)
- Paid hours: 8.0
```

### Test Case 2: Worked With Others
```
Staff: Bob (ID: 2)
Outlet: Hamilton (ID: 1)
Shift: 9am-5pm (8 hours)
Other staff at outlet: Alice 9am-3pm

Expected:
- Total hours: 8.0
- Break deduction: 0.5 (30 minutes)
- Paid hours: 7.5
```

### Test Case 3: Multiple Shifts
```
Staff: Charlie (ID: 3)
Shifts:
  - Morning: 6am-10am (4 hours)
  - Evening: 4pm-10pm (6 hours)
Total: 10 hours

Expected:
- Morning shift: 4.0 hours paid (no break)
- Evening shift: 5.5 hours paid (30 min break deducted)
- Reason: Only longest shift gets break
```

### Test Case 4: Paid Break Location
```
Staff: David (ID: 4)
Outlet: Auckland Central (ID: 18) ‚Üê In paid break list
Shift: 9am-5pm (8 hours)
Other staff present: Yes

Expected:
- Total hours: 8.0
- Break deduction: 0.0 (outlet policy = paid breaks)
- Paid hours: 8.0
```

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

### Changes Made
1. ‚úÖ Moved break calculation to `PayslipCalculationEngine`
2. ‚úÖ Added `didStaffWorkAlone()` method with database query
3. ‚úÖ Integrated with existing `calculateEarnings()` flow
4. ‚úÖ Created test suite verifying both scenarios

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing `calculateDeputyHourBreaksInMinutesBasedOnHoursWorked()` still works
- Old payroll-process.php continues to function
- New system adds database-driven "worked alone" detection
- Both systems can run in parallel during transition
