## 🤖 AI Analysis Features

### 5 Validation Layers

1. **Deputy Timesheet Cross-Check**
   - Validates claimed hours against Deputy roster
   - Flags if claimed > rostered + 0.25 hours
   - Queries: `deputy_timesheets` table

2. **Historical Pattern Analysis**
   - Checks past 6 months for similar claims
   - Flags if ≥5 similar claims (potential pattern)
   - Flags if ≥10 small claims in 3 months (gaming)

3. **Amount Reasonableness**
   - Type-specific maximum amounts
   - Examples:
     - underpaid_hours: 25% of ordinary hours
     - missing_overtime: $500
     - missing_reimbursement: $500
   - Flags suspiciously round amounts (>$100, divisible by 50)

4. **Evidence Quality**
   - OCR confidence check (must be >0.8)
   - Required fields validation (date, total)
   - MIME type validation

5. **Timing Analysis**
   - Flags submissions >30 days after payment
   - Earlier submissions = higher confidence

### Auto-Approval Logic

**Conditions (ALL must be true):**
- ✅ risk_score < 0.30
- ✅ confidence > 0.70
- ✅ claimed_amount < $200
- ✅ No anomalies detected

**If approved automatically:**
- Status → `auto_approved`
- Amendment created immediately
- Staff notified instantly
- Resolution time: "Immediate"

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### 1. Execute Database Schema

```bash
# From project root
mysql -u jcepnzzkmj -p'wprKh9Jq63' jcepnzzkmj < \
  modules/human_resources/payroll/_schema/wage_discrepancies_schema.sql
```

**Verify tables created:**
```bash
mysql -u jcepnzzkmj -p'wprKh9Jq63' jcepnzzkmj \
  -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'payroll_wage_%'"
```

**Expected output:**
```
payroll_wage_discrepancies
payroll_wage_discrepancy_events
```

### 2. Add Routes (if not auto-loaded)

Edit: `/modules/human_resources/payroll/routes.php`

```php
// WAGE DISCREPANCY ENDPOINTS
$router->post('/api/payroll/discrepancies/submit',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@submit');

$router->get('/api/payroll/discrepancies/{id}',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@getDiscrepancy');

$router->get('/api/payroll/discrepancies/pending',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@getPending');

$router->get('/api/payroll/discrepancies/my-history',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@getMyHistory');

$router->post('/api/payroll/discrepancies/{id}/approve',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@approve');

$router->post('/api/payroll/discrepancies/{id}/decline',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@decline');

$router->post('/api/payroll/discrepancies/{id}/upload-evidence',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@uploadEvidence');

$router->get('/api/payroll/discrepancies/statistics',
    'WageDiscrepancyController@getStatistics');
```

### 3. Create Evidence Directory

```bash
mkdir -p /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/private/payroll_evidence
chmod 750 /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/private/payroll_evidence
```

### 4. Test API Endpoints

**Test 1: Submit discrepancy (as staff)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/api/payroll/discrepancies/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payslip_id": 123,
    "discrepancy_type": "underpaid_hours",
    "description": "I worked 8 hours on Monday but only got paid for 6 hours. I have my timesheet approval from my manager.",
    "claimed_hours": 2.0,
    "claimed_amount": 46.00
  }'
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "discrepancy_id": 1,
  "status": "auto_approved",
  "ai_analysis": {
    "risk_score": 0.15,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "anomalies": [],
    "recommendation": "approve",
    "auto_approve": true,
    "reasoning": "Low risk claim with no anomalies detected..."
  },
  "estimated_resolution_time": "Immediate",
  "message": "Your discrepancy has been automatically approved..."
}
```

**Test 2: Get pending (as admin)**
```bash
curl https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/api/payroll/discrepancies/pending
```

**Test 3: Get statistics (as admin)**
```bash
curl https://staff.vapeshed.co.nz/api/payroll/discrepancies/statistics
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### Staff Submission Flow

```
1. Staff submits discrepancy via /submit endpoint
   ↓
2. WageDiscrepancyService->submitDiscrepancy() called
   ↓
3. AI Analysis runs (5 layers):
   - Deputy timesheet check
   - Historical pattern check
   - Amount validation
   - Evidence quality check
   - Timing analysis
   ↓
4. Risk score + confidence calculated
   ↓
5. Auto-approval check:
   - risk < 0.3? ✓
   - confidence > 0.7? ✓
   - amount < $200? ✓
   - no anomalies? ✓
   ↓
6a. IF AUTO-APPROVED:
    - Status → auto_approved
    - Amendment created automatically
    - Staff notified
    - Resolution: Immediate

6b. IF NEEDS REVIEW:
    - Status → pending_review
    - Added to manager queue
    - Staff notified
    - Resolution: 2-7 days based on priority
```

### Manager Review Flow

```
1. Manager opens pending queue
   ↓
2. Discrepancies sorted by:
   - Priority (urgent → high → medium → low)
   - Submission date (oldest first)
   ↓
3. Manager reviews AI analysis:
   - Risk score
   - Confidence
   - Anomalies found
   - Reasoning explanation
   ↓
4. Manager decision:

   4a. APPROVE:
       - Calls /approve endpoint
       - Amendment created
       - Staff notified

   4b. DECLINE:
       - Calls /decline endpoint
       - Decline reason required (min 20 chars)
       - Staff notified with reason
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Edit: `/modules/human_resources/payroll/services/WageDiscrepancyService.php`

**Auto-Approval Thresholds (Lines 474-476):**
```php
// Current values:
$riskThreshold = 0.30;      // Max risk score for auto-approval
$confidenceThreshold = 0.70; // Min confidence for auto-approval
$amountThreshold = 200.00;   // Max amount for auto-approval

// To make stricter (less auto-approvals):
$riskThreshold = 0.20;
$confidenceThreshold = 0.80;
$amountThreshold = 100.00;

// To make more lenient (more auto-approvals):
$riskThreshold = 0.40;
$confidenceThreshold = 0.60;
$amountThreshold = 300.00;
```

**Risk Score Weights (Lines 270-283):**
```php
// Each anomaly adds to risk score
foreach ($anomalies as $anomaly) {
    $weights = [
        'deputy_mismatch' => 0.30,       // No Deputy timesheet found
        'deputy_hours_mismatch' => 0.25, // Hours don't match roster
        'frequent_claimant' => 0.20,     // ≥5 similar claims in 6 months
        'suspicious_amount' => 0.15,     // Amount too high or round
        'low_ocr_confidence' => 0.10,    // OCR confidence <0.8
        'timing_late' => 0.05,           // Submitted >30 days late
        'small_claim_pattern' => 0.25,   // ≥10 small claims in 3 months
    ];
}
```

**Reasonable Amount Limits (Lines 385-393):**
```php
$maxAmounts = [
    'underpaid_hours' => $ordinaryHours * 0.25, // 25% of ordinary hours
    'missing_overtime' => 500.00,
    'missing_bonus' => 1000.00,
    'missing_reimbursement' => 500.00,
    'incorrect_deduction' => 200.00,
    'missing_holiday_pay' => 500.00,
    'other' => 200.00
];
```

   - MIME type validation (jpg, png, gif, pdf only)
   - File size limit (10MB max)
   - SHA256 hash for deduplication
   - Stored outside public_html
   - Original filename discarded

3. **SQL Injection Prevention:**
   - All queries use prepared statements
   - No dynamic SQL concatenation

   - Timestamps on all records

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexes:**
   - 9 indexes on payroll_wage_discrepancies
   - Composite index for pending queue
   - Evidence hash index for duplicate detection

2. **Query Optimization:**
   - Pending queue limited to 100 records
   - History limited to 20 records by default
   - Statistics cached (consider caching layer)

3. **File Storage:**
   - Evidence files stored with hash-based names
   - Prevents directory listing
   - Consider S3/CloudFlare R2 for scale

4. **OCR Processing:**
   - Async queue recommended for production
   - OpenAI Vision API has rate limits
   - Consider batching for multiple uploads

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Low-Risk Auto-Approval
```json
{
  "payslip_id": 123,
  "discrepancy_type": "underpaid_hours",
  "description": "I worked 2 extra hours on Tuesday but they weren't included in my pay. My manager John approved the timesheet.",
  "claimed_hours": 2.0,
  "claimed_amount": 46.00
}
```
**Expected:** Auto-approved (small amount, reasonable, no anomalies)

### Scenario 2: High-Risk Manual Review
```json
{
  "payslip_id": 123,
  "discrepancy_type": "missing_bonus",
  "description": "I was promised a $5,000 bonus for hitting sales targets but it wasn't in my pay.",
  "claimed_amount": 5000.00
}
```
**Expected:** Pending review (large amount, requires evidence)

### Scenario 3: Duplicate Detection
```bash
# Submit same discrepancy twice (same payslip + type)
# Expected: Second submission rejected with duplicate error
```

### Scenario 4: Pattern Detection
```bash
# Staff has submitted 5 similar claims in past 6 months
# Expected: Flagged as "frequent_claimant", risk score increased
```
