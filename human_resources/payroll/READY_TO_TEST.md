**Check:**
1. Bootstrap 5 CDN loading
2. Custom CSS loading
3. Browser cache (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check header.php included
5. Check footer.php included

### If Actions Don't Work
**Problem:** Buttons not responding
**Check:**
1. JavaScript console for errors
2. AJAX endpoints returning data
3. CSRF token present
4. User permissions correct
5. Check footer.php JavaScript loaded
