# 🔐 Payroll Module - Authentication System

## Quick Start

### Current Status: DISABLED ✅

Authentication is currently **DISABLED** for development and testing purposes. All 56 protected routes are accessible without login.

### Check Status (5 seconds)
```bash
./auth-control.sh status
```

### Toggle Authentication
```bash
./auth-control.sh disable  # Turn OFF (current state)
./auth-control.sh enable   # Turn ON (for production)
```

## 🎯 Common Tasks

### I Want to...

#### Test Without Authentication (Current State)
✅ **Already done!** Auth is disabled.
```bash
# Verify it's working
php tests/verify-auth-disabled.php
```

#### Enable Authentication for Production
```bash
# Option 1: Control script
./auth-control.sh enable

# Option 2: Manual edit
# Edit: modules/config/app.php line 39
# Change to: 'payroll_auth_enabled' => true,

# Verify
./auth-control.sh status
```

#### Verify Authentication Status
```bash
# Quick check
php -r "\$c=require'../../config/app.php';echo \$c['payroll_auth_enabled']?'ENABLED':'DISABLED';"

# Full verification
php tests/verify-auth-disabled.php

# Or use control script
./auth-control.sh status
```

#### Run All Tests
```bash
./tests/fix-and-run-tests.sh
```

#### View Test Results
```bash
# Unit tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit

# Security tests
cat tests/security-test-results.txt
```

#### Debug Authentication Issues
```bash
# 1. Check config value
cat ../../config/app.php | grep payroll_auth_enabled

# 2. Check enforcement logic
grep -A 5 "authEnabled" index.php

# 3. Test endpoint directly
curl -I http://your-domain/payroll/dashboard

# 4. Review logs
tail -f logs/payroll.log
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### The Global Flag
Located in: `modules/config/app.php` line 39
```php
'payroll_auth_enabled' => false,  // Set to true for production
```

### How It Works
1. **Flag is checked** in `index.php` before route execution
2. **When FALSE**: All authentication checks are bypassed
3. **When TRUE**: Normal authentication is enforced
4. **Scope**: Affects ALL 56 protected routes

### What Changes With The Flag

| Flag = FALSE (Current) | Flag = TRUE (Production) |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| No login required | Login required |
| All routes accessible | Protected routes blocked |
| Returns 404 if not found | Returns 401 if not authenticated |
| Good for testing | Good for production |

---

## 🧪 Verification Commands

### Quick Verification (10 seconds)
```bash
# Check flag value
./auth-control.sh status

# Test endpoint access
curl -I http://your-domain/payroll/dashboard
# Should return 404 (not 401) when auth disabled
```

### Full Verification (30 seconds)
```bash
# Run verification suite
php tests/verify-auth-disabled.php

# Expected output:
# ✅ Configuration: FALSE
# ✅ Authentication DISABLED globally
# ✅ 3 endpoints tested - all accessible
# ✅ VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
```

### Comprehensive Testing (5 minutes)
```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/fix-and-run-tests.sh

# Check specific areas:
# - Unit tests (8 tests)
# - Security configuration
# - Route definitions
# - Database schema
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Auth still appears to be enabled"
```bash
# 1. Check config file
cat ../../config/app.php | grep payroll_auth_enabled

# 2. If it shows 'true', disable it
./auth-control.sh disable

# 3. Verify change
./auth-control.sh status
```

### "Getting 401 Unauthorized errors"
```bash
# This means auth is enabled. To disable:
./auth-control.sh disable

# Then verify
php tests/verify-auth-disabled.php
```

### "Getting 404 errors"
This is normal when auth is disabled! 404 means:
- Auth is bypassed ✅
- Route might not exist or controller not implemented
- This is NOT an auth error

### "Control script not working"
```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x auth-control.sh

# Run with bash explicitly
bash auth-control.sh status
```

## 📊 Route Coverage

### Total Routes: 57
- **56 routes** with `auth => true` (now bypassed when flag is false)
- **1 route** with `auth => false` (always accessible)

### Categories:
- Amendment routes: 6
- Automation routes: 5  
- Xero integration: 5
- Wage discrepancy: 5
- Staff payment: 8
- Dashboard: 3
- Additional endpoints: 25+

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current State (Auth Disabled)
⚠️ **WARNING:** All data is accessible without authentication
- Suitable for: Local development, testing environments
- NOT suitable for: Production, staging with real data

### Production State (Auth Enabled)
✅ Authentication enforced on all protected routes
✅ Permission system active
✅ CSRF protection enabled
✅ Session security configured
