### Objective 4: Remove Fallback DB Credentials (15 min)

**Task:** Find and remove hard-coded database credentials

**Commands to start:**
```bash
# Search for hard-coded credentials
grep -r "password\s*=\s*['\"]" --include="*.php" | grep -v vendor | grep -v ".git"

# Check for DB credentials
grep -r "DB_PASS\|DB_PASSWORD\|db_password" --include="*.php" | grep -v vendor

# Check index.php getPayrollDb() function
grep -A 20 "function getPayrollDb" index.php
```

**Plan:**
1. Find all hard-coded credentials
2. Move to .env or remove entirely
3. Add validation for required env vars (fail fast if missing)
4. Add tests for credential handling
5. Commit
