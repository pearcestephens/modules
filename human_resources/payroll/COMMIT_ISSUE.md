# ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE DETECTED: Wrong Files Committed

## What Happened

The commit at `2b15101` only renamed consignment files (moved to docs/ and _trash/).
It did NOT commit the payroll changes we made (BaseController.php, index.php, tests, etc.).

## Let's Check What's Actually There

Run this to diagnose:
```bash
bash check-status.sh
```

This will tell us:
1. ‚úÖ What files exist
2. üîÑ What's uncommitted
3. üìù What was in the last commit
4. üí° What to do next

## Likely Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Files Already Committed Earlier
If the changes were already committed in a previous session, we're done!
Just continue to Objective 4.

### Scenario 2: Changes Not Saved
If files weren't actually modified, we need to re-apply the changes.

### Scenario 3: Wrong Directory
We might be in the wrong git repository directory.

## Quick Check Commands

```bash
# See if there are uncommitted changes
git status

# See what changed in the last commit
git show --stat HEAD

# See if BaseController.php was modified
git log --oneline --all -- controllers/BaseController.php | head -5

# See if index.php was modified
git log --oneline --all -- index.php | head -5
```

## What We SHOULD Have Committed

- `controllers/BaseController.php` (+140 lines)
- `index.php` (+90 lines)  
- `tests/Unit/BaseControllerHelpersTest.php` (NEW)
- `tests/Unit/ValidationEngineTest.php` (NEW)
- `tests/Integration/ControllerValidationTest.php` (NEW)
- `tests/Security/StaticFileSecurityTest.php` (NEW)
- `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` (updated)
- Documentation files

**Run `bash check-status.sh` first, then tell me what it says!**
