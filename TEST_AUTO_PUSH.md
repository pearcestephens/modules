# ðŸ§ª Quick Test: Auto-Push Monitor

Run this to verify auto-push is working:

```bash
# 1. Check monitor is running
php .auto-push-monitor.php status

# 2. Edit a test file
echo "Test content: $(date)" >> .test-push.txt

# 3. Wait for auto-push (up to 5 minutes)
tail -f .auto-push.log

# Expected in log:
# [TIMESTAMP] Detected 1 changed files
# [TIMESTAMP] Created commit: Auto-push: ... (1 files)
# [TIMESTAMP] âœ“ Pushed to GitHub

# 4. Check GitHub to see new commit
# Visit: https://github.com/pearcestephens/modules/commits/main

# 5. View new commit locally
git log --oneline -1

# 6. Cleanup test file
rm .test-push.txt
```
